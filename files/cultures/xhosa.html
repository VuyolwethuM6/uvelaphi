                    <h3>Xhosa people</h3>
                    <p>
                         AmaXhosa sometimes referred to as the Xhosa-speaking people or AbeNguni, are a Bantu ethnic
                         group whose
                         traditional homeland is primarily the Eastern Cape province. they are the second largest ethnic
                         group in South Africa. The Xhosa Kingdom is made up of two houses. The houses are the Gcaleka
                         House(Great House) and Rharhabe House(Right Hand House); The Rharhabe House is made up of
                         chiefships AmaNgqika, amaMbalu, amaNtinde, amaGqunukhwebe, imiDange, imiDushane, and
                         amaNdlambe. The traditional Xhosa territory is between the Mbhashe River and Xelexwa River or
                         Gamtoos River in Jeffreys Bay; inland, it goes all the way to the Winterberg Mountains near
                         Somerset East. In addition, there are other Xhosa-speaking states or Kingdoms that were
                         tributary or owed allegiance to the Xhosa Kingdom; in their North East beyond the Mbhashe
                         River, states such as the Thembu settled between Mbhashe and Mthatha Rivers, Bhaca between the
                         Tina and Mzimvubu rivers, abakoBhosha, Mpondo settled between Mthatha and Mtamvuna Rivers,
                         Mpondomise settled between Tina, Tsitsa and Mthatha Rivers and amaQwathi settled inland in
                         Thembuland that have different kingship lineages and since their founding or expansion, have
                         adopted the isiXhosa language and the Xhosa way of life.

                         <br><br>
                         Presently, approximately eight million Xhosa people are distributed across the country, and the
                         Xhosa language is South Africa's second-most-populous home language, after the Zulu language,
                         to which Xhosa is closely related. The pre-1994 apartheid system of Bantustans suspended the
                         Xhosa South African citizenship, but assigned them to have self-governing "homelands" (native
                         reserves), namely; Transkei and Ciskei, now both a part of the Eastern Cape Province where most
                         Xhosa remain. Many Xhosa live in Cape Town (eKapa in Xhosa), East London (eMonti), and Port
                         Elizabeth (e-Bhayi).
                         <br><br>
                         As of 2003, the majority of Xhosa speakers, approximately 5.3 million, lived in the Eastern
                         Cape, followed by the Western Cape (approximately 1 million), Gauteng (671,045), the Free State
                         (246,192), KwaZulu-Natal (219,826), North West (214,461), Mpumalanga (46,553), the Northern
                         Cape (51,228), and Limpopo (14,225).
                         <br><br>
                         There is a small but significant Xhosa-speaking (Mfengu) community in Zimbabwe, and their
                         language, isiXhosa, is recognised as a national language. This community is based on a diaspora
                         that moved up from the Cape in South Africa upon the setting up of Rhodesia with Cecil Rhodes.
                    </p><br>

                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <p>
                         Some archaeological evidence has been discovered that suggests that Xhosa-speaking people have
                         lived in the Cape area since at least the 7th century AD. Genetically the modern Xhosa are a
                         blend of politically dominant ancient agriculturalists of Nguni stock, Khoi pastoralists & San
                         hunter-gatherers.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Origins</h4>
                    <p>

                         The Xhosa people are descendants of the Ngunis who migrated from North Africa to Africa's Great
                         Lakes Region, eventually settling in Southern Africa. Xhosa oral history also mentions a
                         historical settlement called 'Eluhlangeni' believed to have been in East Africa in which the
                         Ngunis lived in for some time before continuing with their migration.

                         Upon crossing mountains and rivers in South Africa, these farm-working agro-pastoralists
                         brought their sheep, cattle and goats with them and displaced the weaker San groups in the
                         region. They also brought weapons, notably their assegais and their shields and would form
                         groups or chiefdoms and kingdoms mainly in what is now the Eastern Cape.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Kingdom</h4>
                    <p>
                         According to oral tradition, the modern Xhosa Kingdom was founded somewhere before the 15th
                         century by Tshawe (whom the royal clan of the Xhosas is named after) who overthrew his brother
                         Cirha (assisted by his brother Jwarha) with the help of the amaNgwevu clan of the Mpondomise
                         state. Tshawe and his army then incorporated formerly independent Nguni clans into the Xhosa
                         Kingdom. Also Khoikhoi tribes were incorporated, these include the Inqua, the Giqwa and the
                         amaNgqosini (both khoi and sotho origin).
                         <br><br>
                         Formerly independent clans (many of khoi origin) and chiefdoms in the region became tributary
                         to the amaTshawe and spoke isiXhosa as their main language.

                         Xhosa identity became political, rather than narrow ethnic, and anyone who accepted the House
                         of Tshawe as rulers became Xhosa.

                         The Xhosa polity achieved political ascendancy over most of the Cape Khoi extending to the very
                         fringes of the Cape Peninsula.
                         <br><br>
                         With the settlement of the Cape by Europeans in 1652, the native populations were gradually
                         pushed eastwards, until, in the 1700s, the borders of the Cape Colony had pushed populations
                         far enough east (with relations between colonist and native significantly broken down) to
                         create a critical mass of hostile population to resist the colonists in the Eastern Cape. This
                         sparked off the Cape frontier wars, which represent some of the longest military resistance to
                         colonialism on the African continent.
                         <br><br>
                         The historical end-result would be the containment of large portions of the Cape native
                         population into native reserves in the Easternmost part of the Cape. However these populations
                         would also continually serve as the labour inside the Cape Colony. These native reserves would
                         be re-branded "homelands" in the 20th century and would only be fully dismantled in 1994 with
                         populations moving back into the wider Cape.
                         <br><br>
                         In the 19th century, the Xhosas fought and repulsed many tribes that were escaping the Zulus in
                         Natal, this was during the historical mfecane. Those who were accepted were assimilated into
                         the Xhosa cultural way of life and followed Xhosa traditions. The Xhosas
                         called these various tribes AmaMfengu, meaning wanderers, and were made up of clans such as the
                         amaBhaca, amaBhele, amaHlubi, amaZizi and Rhadebe. To this day, the descendants of the
                         amaMfengu are part of the Xhosa people and they speak isiXhosa and practice the Xhosa culture.
                         <br><br>
                         Xhosa unity and ability to fight off colonial encroachment was to be weakened by the famines
                         and political divisions that followed the cattle-killing movement of 1856-1858. Historians now
                         view this movement as a millennialist response, both directly to a lung disease spreading among
                         Xhosa cattle at the time, and less directly to the stress to Xhosa society caused by the
                         continuing loss of their territory and autonomy.
                         <br><br>
                         Some historians argue that this early absorption into the wage economy is the ultimate origin
                         of the long history of trade union membership and political leadership among Xhosa
                         people.That history manifests itself today in high degrees of Xhosa
                         representation in the leadership of the African National Congress (ANC), South Africa's ruling
                         political party in the government
                    </p><br>

                    <h3>Language</h3>
                    <p>
                         Xhosa is an agglutinative tonal language categorized as Bantu. While the Xhosas call their
                         language "isiXhosa", it is usually referred to as "Xhosa" in English. Written Xhosa uses a
                         Latin alphabet-based system. Xhosa is spoken by about 18% of the South African population, and
                         has some mutual intelligibility with Zulu, especially Zulu spoken in urban areas. Many Xhosa
                         speakers, particularly those living in urban areas, also speak Zulu and/or Afrikaans and/or
                         English.
                    </p><br>

                    <h3>Folklore and religion</h3>
                    <p>
                         Traditional healers of South Africa include diviners (amagqirha). This job is mostly taken by
                         women, who spend five years in apprenticeship. There are also herbalists (amaxhwele), prophets
                         (izanuse), and healers (iinyanga) for the community.
                         <br><br>
                         The Xhosas have a strong oral tradition with many stories of ancestral heroes; according to
                         tradition, the leader from whose name the Xhosa people take their name was the first King of
                         the nation. One of Xhosa's descendants named Phalo gave birth to two sons, Gcaleka kaPhalo, the
                         heir, and Rarabe ka Phalo, a son from the Right Hand house. Rarabe was a great warrior and a
                         man of great ability who was much loved by his father. Gcaleka was a meek and listless man who
                         did not possess all the qualities befitting of a future king. Matters were also complicated by
                         Gcaleka's initiation as a diviner, which was a forbidden practice for members of the royal
                         family.
                         <br><br>
                         Seeing the popularity of his brother and fearing that he might one day challenge him for the
                         throne, Gcaleka attempted to usurp the throne from his father, but Rarabe would come to his
                         father's aid and quell the insurrection. With the blessing of his father, who provided him
                         retinue and also accompanied him; Rarabe would leave the great place and settle in the Amathole
                         Mountains region. There, he destroyed the weaker Khoikhoi tribes and killed Hinsati of the
                         khoikhoi and bought the land. He would then rule over the various Xhosa clans there and the
                         Right Hand House of the Xhosa Kingdom was founded.
                         <br><br>
                         The key figure in the Xhosa oral tradition is the imbongi (plural: iimbongi) or praise singer.
                         imbongi traditionally live close to the chief's "great place" (the cultural and political focus
                         of his activity); they accompany the chief on important occasions - the imbongi Zolani Mkiva
                         preceded Nelson Mandela at his presidential inauguration in 1994. imbongis' poetry, called
                         imibongo, praises the actions and adventures of chiefs and ancestors.
                         <br><br>
                         The supreme being is called uThixo or uQamata. In Xhosa tradition, the ancestors act as
                         intermediaries between the living and God; they are honoured in rituals in order to bring good
                         fortune. Dreams play an important role in divination and contact with ancestors. Traditional
                         religious practice features rituals, initiations, and feasts. Modern rituals typically pertain
                         to matters of illness and psychological well-being.
                         <br><br>
                         Christian missionaries established outposts among the Xhosa in the 1820s, and the first Bible
                         translation was in the mid-1850s, partially done by Henry Hare Dugmore. Xhosa did not convert
                         in great numbers until the 20th century, but now many are Christian, particularly within the
                         African initiated churches such as the Zion Christian Church. Some denominations combine
                         Christianity with traditional beliefs.

                    <h3>Rites of passage</h3>
                    <p>
                         The Xhosa are a South African cultural group who emphasise traditional practices and customs
                         inherited from their forefathers. Each person within the Xhosa culture has their place which is
                         recognised by the entire community. Starting from birth, a Xhosa person goes through graduation
                         stages which recognise their growth and assign them a recognised place in the community. Each
                         stage is marked by a specific ritual aimed at introducing the individual to their counterparts
                         and also to their ancestors. Starting from imbeleko, a ritual performed to introduce a new born
                         to the ancestors, to umphumo (the homecoming), from inkwenkwe (a boy) to indoda (a man). These
                         rituals and ceremonies are sancrosact to the identity and heritage of the Xhosa and other
                         African descendents. Though some western scholars question the relevance of these practices
                         today, even urbanised Xhosa people do still follow them. The ulwaluko and intonjane are also
                         traditions which separated this tribe from the rest of the Nguni tribes. These are performed to
                         mark the transition from child to adulthood. Zulus once performed the ritual but King Shaka
                         stopped it because of war in the 1810s. In 2009, it was reintroduced by King Goodwill
                         Zwelithini Zulu, not as a custom, but as a medical procedure to curb HIV infections.
                         <br><br>
                         All these rituals are symbolic of one's development. Before each is performed, the individual
                         spends time with community elders to prepare for the next stage. The elders' teachings are not
                         written, but transmitted from generation to generation by oral tradition. The iziduko (clan)
                         for instance—which matters most to the Xhosa identity (even more than names and surnames) are
                         transferred from one to the other through oral tradition. Knowing your isiduko is vital to the
                         Xhosas and it is considered a shame and uburhanuka (lack-of-identity) if one doesn't know one's
                         clan. This is considered so important that when two strangers meet for the first time, the
                         first identity that gets shared is isiduko. It is so important that two people with the same
                         surname but different clan names are considered total strangers, but two people from the same
                         clan but with different surnames are regarded as close relatives. This forms the roots of
                         ubuntu (human kindness) - a behaviour synonymous to this tribe as extending a helping hand to a
                         complete stranger when in need. Ubuntu goes further than just helping one another - it is so
                         deep that it even extends to looking after and reprimanding your neighbour's child when in the
                         wrong. Hence the saying "it takes a village to raise a child".
                         <br><br>
                         One traditional ritual that is still regularly practiced is the manhood ritual, a secret rite
                         that marks the transition from boyhood to manhood, ulwaluko. After ritual circumcision, the
                         initiates (abakwetha) live in isolation for up to several weeks, often in the mountains. During
                         the process of healing they smear white clay on their bodies and observe numerous customs.
                         <br><br>
                         In modern times the practice has caused controversy, with over 825 circumcision- and
                         initiation-related deaths since 1994, and the spread of sexually transmitted infections,
                         including HIV, via the practice of circumcising initiates with the same blade. In March
                         2007, a controversial mini-series dealing with Xhosa circumcision and initiation rites debuted
                         on South African Broadcasting Corporation. Titled Umthunzi Wentaba, the series was taken off
                         the air after complaints by traditional leaders that the rites are secret and not to be
                         revealed to non-initiates and women. In January 2014 the website ulwaluko.co.za was
                         released by a Dutch medical doctor. It features a gallery of photographs of injured penises,
                         which sparked outrage amongst traditional leaders in the Eastern Cape. The South African
                         Film and Publication Board ruled that the website was "scientific with great educative value",
                         addressing a "societal problem needing urgent intervention".
                         <br><br>
                         Girls are also initiated into womanhood (Intonjane). They too are secluded, though for a
                         shorter period. Female initiates are not circumcised.
                         <br><br>
                         Other rites include the seclusion of mothers for ten days after giving birth, and the burial of
                         the afterbirth and umbilical cord near the village. This is reflected in the traditional
                         greeting Inkaba yakho iphi?, literally "where is your navel?" The answer "tells someone where
                         you live, what your clan affiliation is, and what your social status is and contains a wealth
                         of undisclosed cultural information. Most importantly, it determines where you belong".

                    <h3>Rituals surrounding umtshato (Xhosa marriage)</h3>
                    <p>
                         Xhosa marriage, umtshato, is one that is filled with a number of customs and rituals which
                         relate to the upkeep of Xhosa traditional practices. These rituals have been practiced for
                         decades by the Xhosa people and have been incorporated into modern day Xhosa marriages as well.
                         The purpose of the practices is to bring together two different families and to give guidance
                         to the newly wed couple throughout.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Ukuthwalwa</h4>
                    <p>
                         To start off the procedures the male intending to marry goes through Ukuthwalwa which entails
                         him choosing his future bride and making his intentions of marriage known, however this
                         practice was not done by all the tribes within the xhosa people. In modern day, the man and
                         woman would most likely have been in courtship or a relationship prior to Ukuthwalwa. Decades
                         before Ukuthwalwa would entail legal bridal abduction, where the man could choose a woman of
                         his liking to be his bride and go into negotiations with the family of the bride without her
                         knowledge or consent. She would have to abide to the marriage as per tradition
                    </p>

                    <h4>Isiduko</h4>
                    <p>
                         Following Ukuthwala, the man will then be in discussion with his parents or relatives to inform
                         them of his choice in bride. During this discussion the clan name, isiduko, of the woman would
                         be revealed and researched. If it were found that the woman and the man share the same clan
                         name they would not be allowed to proceed with the marriage as it is said that people with the
                         same clan name are of the same relation and cannot be wed
                    </p>

                    <h4>Ikhazi</h4>
                    <p>
                         Once discussions with the family are complete and satisfactory information about the woman is
                         acquired then the family of the man will proceed to appoint marriage negotiators. It is these
                         very negotiators that will travel to the family of the woman to make known the man and his
                         intentions. Once the negotiators reach the family of the woman they will be kept in the kraal,
                         inkundla, of the woman's family. If the family does not possess a kraal they will simply be
                         kept outside the household as they will not be allowed to enter the household without the
                         acknowledgment and acceptance of the woman's family. It is here where the lobola (dowry)
                         negotiations will begin. The family of the woman will give them a bride-price and a date for
                         which they must return to pay that price. The bride-price is dependent on numerous things such
                         as her level of education, the wealth status of her family in comparison to that of the man's
                         family, what the man stands to gain in the marriage and the overall desirability of the woman.
                         The payment of the bride-price could be in either cattle or money depending on the family of
                         the woman. The modern Xhosa families would rather prefer money as most are situated in the
                         urban cities where there would be no space nor permits for livestock.
                         <br><br>
                         Upon return of the man's family on the given date, they will pay the bride-price and bring
                         along gifts of offering such as livestock and alcoholic beverages, iswazi, to be drunk by the
                         family of the bride. Once the lobola from the man's negotiators is accepted then they will be
                         considered married by the Xhosa tradition and the celebrations would commence. These include
                         slaughtering of the livestock as a grateful gesture to their ancestors as well as pouring a
                         considerable amount of the alcoholic beverages on the ground of the bride's household to give
                         thanks to their ancestors. The groom's family is then welcomed into the family and traditional
                         beer, Umqombothi, will be prepared for the groom's family as a token of appreciation from the
                         bride's family.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Ukuyalwa</h4>
                    <p>
                         To solidify their unity the family of the bride will head to the groom's household where the
                         elders will address her with regards to how to carry herself and dress appropriately at her
                         newly found household, this is called Ukuyalwa. Furthermore, a new name will also be given
                         to her by the women of the groom's family and this name signifies the bond of the two families.
                    </p><br>

                    <h3>Xhosa burial practices</h3>
                    <p>
                         Burial practices and customs include a specific sequence of events and rituals which need to be
                         performed in order to regard a funeral as dignified. Once the family has been notified that a
                         member has died, the extended family comes together in preparation for the burial of the
                         deceased.
                         <br><br>
                         The "umkhapho" (to accompany) ritual is performed in order to accompany the spirit of the
                         deceased to the land of the ancestors. The local male clan leader or his proxy is the one who
                         facilitates the process. The purpose of umkhapho is to keep the bonds between the deceased
                         person and the bereaved alive so that the deceased may be able to return later and communicate
                         as an ancestor. During this ritual, an animal such as a goat is slaughtered. A larger animal
                         like a cow may also be slaughtered for an important person like a head of the family whilst a
                         goat without a blemish may be slaughtered for others.
                         <br><br>
                         Further customs include the emptying the main bedroom of the bereaving family, known as 'indlu
                         enkulu'. This room is where most of the last respects will be paid by family and friends. The
                         emptying of the room is done in order to create space for extended family members to be able to
                         mourn in the main room. The first family members and/or neighbours to arrive arrange the main
                         bedroom to accommodate this seating arrangement by placing a traditional grass mat (ukhukho) or
                         mattress on the floor.
                         <br><br>
                         Mourners do not require an invitation to attend a funeral and everyone who can and would like
                         to attend is welcome. This means that the bereaved family has to cater for an unknown number of
                         mourners. Traditionally, mourners were fed with 'inkobe', which is boiled dried corn and water,
                         and the corn was taken from the family food reserves as well as donated by family members and
                         neighbours. In the 21st century, it is regarded as taboo to feed mourners with 'inkobe' and, as
                         a result of shame, funeral catering has become a lucrative business for the industry during
                         burial events.

                         Xhosa woman preparing food for large groups of people
                         On the day of burial, before extended family members disperse to their homes, the ukuxukuxa
                         (cleansing) ritual occurs and a goat or sheep or even a fowl is slaughtered.
                         <br><br>
                         A cleansing ritual is done the day after the burial, in which the bereaved women of the family
                         go to the nearest river to wash all the materials and blankets that were used by the deceased
                         before death. Furthermore, the clothes of the deceased are removed from the house and the
                         family members shave their hair. The shaving of hair is an indication that life continues to
                         spring up even after death.

                    <p>
                         The Xhosa settled on mountain slopes of the Amatola and the Winterberg Mountains. Many streams
                         drain into great rivers of this Xhosa territory, including the Kei and Fish Rivers. Rich soils
                         and plentiful rainfall make the river basins good for farming and grazing making cattle
                         important and the basis of wealth.
                         <br><br>
                         Traditional foods include beef (Inyama yenkomo), mutton (Inyama yegusha), and goat meat (Inyama
                         yebhokwe), sorghum, milk (often fermented, called "amasi"), pumpkins (amathanga), Mielie-meal
                         (maize meal), samp (unngqusho), beans (iimbotyi), vegetables, like "rhabe", wild spinach
                         reminiscent of sorrel, "imvomvo", the sweet sap of an aloe, or "ikhowa", a mushroom that grows
                         after summer rains.

                         Traditional music features drums, rattles, whistles, flutes, mouth harps, and
                         stringed-instruments and especially group singing accompanied by hand clapping.[citation
                         needed] There are songs for various ritual occasions; one of the best-known Xhosa songs is a
                         wedding song called "Qongqothwane", performed by Miriam Makeba as "Click Song #1". Besides
                         Makeba, several modern groups record and perform in Xhosa. Missionaries introduced the Xhosa to
                         Western choral singing.[citation needed] "Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika", part of the National anthem
                         of South Africa is a Xhosa hymn written in 1897 by Enoch Sontonga.

                         The first newspapers, novels, and plays in Xhosa appeared in the 19th century,
                         and Xhosa poetry is also gaining renown.

                         Several films have been shot in the Xhosa language. U-Carmen eKhayelitsha is a modern remake of
                         Bizet's 1875 opera Carmen. It is shot entirely in Xhosa, and combines music from the original
                         opera with traditional African music. It takes place in the Cape Town township of Khayelitsha.
                         The movie Black Panther also features the Xhosa language.

                    <p>
                         Beads are small round objects made of glass, wood, metal, nutshell, bone seed and the likes,
                         which are then pierced for stringing. Before glass beads were introduced, people used
                         natural materials to make beads. Xhosa people relied on the San to sell beads to them through
                         trade or barter exchange. Xhosa people would give hemp to the San in exchange for beads. The
                         beads made by the San were made out of ostrich egg shells which were chipped to small size,
                         bored and polished and strung into sinews. Producing them took a long time, so they were
                         scarce, highly priced, valued and in demand. It is recorded that it was only in the 1930s that
                         the Portuguese introduced glass beads through trade.

                    <h3>Xhosa beadwork and its symbolism</h3>
                    <p>
                         Adornments serve a particular purpose across different cultures as social markers. They are
                         used to ascertain where one belongs to with regards to identity, history and geographical
                         location. They reveal personal information with regards to age and gender and social class as
                         some beads were meant to be worn by royalty. Beadwork creates a sense of belonging and cultural
                         identity and traditions hence people draw their cultural ways of living and meanings, as Xhosa
                         people use them as social markers. Xhosa people believe that the beads also create a link
                         between the living and the ancestors as diviners use them during rituals. Thus beads have some
                         spiritual significance.
                         <br><br>
                         Social identities/markers with regards to age, gender, grade, marital status, social rank or
                         role and the spiritual state can be ascertained through Xhosa beadwork. Symbolic references are
                         drawn from the beads through the colour, pattern, formation and motifs. However, it ought to be
                         taken into cognisance that some of these messages are limited to a certain group or between two
                         people. In Xhosa culture beads represent the organisational framework of the people and the
                         rites of passage that people have gone through as the beads are representative of the stages of
                         one's life. Motifs on the beads often used include trees, diamonds, quadrangles, chevrons,
                         triangles, circles, parallel lines that form a pattern that is exclusive to certain age groups.
                         Although the beadwork has some cultural significance with certain motifs having exclusive
                         meanings, the creator of the beadwork has creative control and can create and draw meaning from
                         individual preference. Thus the meanings drawn from the beadwork are not rigidly set.
                         <br><br>
                         Among the Thembu (a tribe in the Eastern Cape often erroneously referred to be a Xhosa tribe),
                         after circumcision, the men wore, and still wear, skirts, turbans and a wide bead collar. A
                         waistcoat, long necklaces, throat bands, armbands, leggings and belts are part of his regalia.
                         The dominant colours in the beadwork are white and navy blue, with some yellow and green beads
                         symbolising fertility and a new life, respectively. Xhosa people regard white as the colour
                         of purity and mediation; white beads are still used as offerings to spirits or to the creator.
                         Amagqirha/diviners use white beads when communicating with the ancestors . These diviners also
                         carry with them beaded spears, which are associated with the ancestors that inspire the
                         diviner; beaded horns; and calabashes, to hold medicinal products or snuff. "Amageza", a veil
                         made of beads, is also part of their regalia, they use these beads by swaying them in someone's
                         eyes so as to induce a trance-like state.
                         <br><br>
                         Inkciyo is a beaded skirt that serves as a garment covering the pubic area. Among the Pondo
                         people (Xhosa clan) the beads are turquoise and white in colour. This skirt is worn during a
                         virginity testing ceremony among Xhosa people undergoing their rites of passage into
                         womanhood.
                         <br><br>
                         Impempe is a whistle that has a necklace on it. The whistle symbolises one's introduction to
                         adolescence.
                         <br><br>
                         Xhosa beadwork and other cultural beadworks have cultural ties, but nowadays beads are also
                         worn as fashion pieces, too, either as cultural appreciation or appropriation. The use of
                         cultural beadworks as fashion pieces means that anyone can wear these pieces without having to
                         belong to that cultural group

                    <h3>Clothing</h3>
                    <p>
                         The Xhosa culture has a traditional dress code informed by the individuals social standing
                         portraying different stages of life. The 'red blanket people' (Xhosa people) have a custom of
                         wearing red blankets dyed with red ochre, the intensity of the colour varying from tribe to
                         tribe. Other clothing includes beadwork and printed fabrics. Although in general, Xhosa
                         lifestyle has been adapted to Western traditions, the Xhosa people still wear traditional
                         attire for special cultural activities. The various tribes have their own variations of
                         traditional dress which includes the colour of their garments and beadwork. This allows for
                         different Xhosa groups to be able to be distinguishable from one another due to their different
                         styles of dress. The Gcaleka women, for instance, encase their arms and legs in beads and brass
                         bangles and some also wear neck beads
                    </p>

                    <h4>Women</h4>
                    <p>
                         Unmarried women often wear wraps tied around their shoulders, leaving their breasts exposed.
                         Engaged women redden their plaited hair and let it screen their eyes, this was done as a sign
                         of respect for their fiancés. Xhosa women wear some form of headdress to cover their heads as a
                         sign of respect to the head of the family which is either their father or husband. Elderly
                         Xhosa women are allowed to wear more elaborate headpieces because of their seniority.

                         Xhosa men traditionally filled the roles as hunters, warriors and stockman, therefore animal
                         skin forms an important part of their traditional wear. Men often wear goatskin bags in which
                         to carry essentials such as tobacco and a knife. The bag is usually made from skin that had
                         been removed in one piece, cured without removing the hair, and turned inside out. On special
                         occasions such as weddings or initiation ceremonies, Xhosa men wear embroidered skirts with a
                         rectangular cloth over the left shoulder alternatively, a tunic and strands of beaded necklaces
                         can be worn.

                    <h3>Xhosas in modern society</h3>
                    <p>
                         Xhosa people currently make up approximately 18% of the South African population. The Xhosa are
                         the second largest cultural group in South Africa, after the Zulu-speaking nation.
                         Under apartheid, adult literacy rates were as low as 30%, and in 1996 studies
                         estimated the literacy level of first-language Xhosa speakers at approximately 50%. There
                         have been advances since then, however.
                         <br><br>
                         Education in primary-schools serving Xhosa-speaking communities is conducted in Xhosa, but this
                         is replaced by English after the early primary grades. Xhosa is still considered as a studied
                         subject, however, and it is possible to major in Xhosa at university level. Most of the
                         students at Walter Sisulu University and University of Fort Hare speak Xhosa. Rhodes University
                         in Grahamstown, additionally, offers courses in Xhosa for both mother-tongue and
                         non-mother-tongue speakers. These courses both include a cultural studies component. Professor
                         Russel H. Kaschula, Head of the School of Languages at Rhodes, has published multiple papers on
                         Xhosa culture and oral literature.
                         <br><br>
                         The effects of government policies during the years of apartheid can still be seen in the
                         poverty of the Xhosa who still reside in the Eastern Cape. During this time, Xhosa males could
                         only seek employment in the mining industry as so-called migrant labourers. Since the collapse
                         of apartheid, individuals can move freely.
                         <br><br>
                         After the breakdown of apartheid, migration to Gauteng and Cape Town has become increasingly
                         common, especially amongst rural Xhosa people.

                    <h4>Traditionally</h4>
                    <p>
                         The traditional Xhosa names for months of the year poetically come from names of stars, plants,
                         and flowers that grow or seasonal changes that happen at a given time of year in Southern
                         Africa.

                         The Xhosa year traditionally begins in June and ends in May when the brightest star visible in
                         the Southern Hemisphere, Canopus, signals the time for harvesting.

                         In urban areas today, anglicized versions of the months are used, especially by the younger
                         generation, but in the rural areas of the Eastern Cape, the old names still stand.
                         <br><br>

                    <h3>IsiXhosa Clan names</h3>
                    <p>
                         Xhosa clan names (isiduko) are family names which are
                         considered more important than surnames among Xhosa people. Much like the clan system of
                         Scotland, each Xhosa person can trace their family history back to a specific male ancestor or
                         stock. Mentioning the clan name of someone you wish to thank is the highest form of respect,
                         and it is considered polite to enquire after someone’s clan name when you meet them. The clan
                         name is also sometimes used as an exclamation by members of that clan. When a woman marries she
                         may take her husband’s surname, but she always keeps her own clan name, adding the prefix Ma-
                         to it. A man and a woman who have the same clan name may not marry, as they are considered to
                         be related. Clan names A few clan names of amaXhosa and related ethnic groups include:
