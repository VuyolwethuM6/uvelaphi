                    <h3>The Zulu People</h3>
                    <p>
                         The Zulu people or AmaZulu are a Nguni ethnic group in Southern Africa. The Zulu people are the
                         largest ethnic group and nation in South Africa, with an estimated 10-12 million people, living
                         mainly in the province of KwaZulu-Natal. <br><br>
                         They originated from Nguni communities who took part in the Bantu migrations over millennia. As
                         the clans integrated together, the rulership of Shaka brought success to the Zulu nation due to
                         his improved military tactics and organization. <br><br>
                         Zulus take pride in their ceremonies such as the Umhlanga, or Reed Dance, and their various
                         forms of beadwork.
                         The art and skill of beadwork takes part in the identification of Zulu people and acts as a
                         form of communication. The men and women both serve different purposes in society in order to
                         function as a whole. Today the Zulu people predominantly believe in Christianity, but have
                         created a syncretic religion that is combined with the Zulu's prior belief systems.
                    </p><br>
                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <h4>Origins</h4>
                    <p>The Zulu were originally a major clan in what is today Northern KwaZulu-Natal, founded ca. 1709
                         by Zulu kaMalandela. In the Nguni languages, iZulu means heaven, or weather. At that time, the
                         area was occupied by many large Nguni communities and clans (also called the isizwe people or
                         nation, or were called isibongo, referring to their clan or family name). Nguni communities had
                         migrated down Africa's east coast over millennia, as part of the Bantu migrations. As the
                         nation began to develop, the rulership of Shaka brought the clans together to build a cohesive
                         identity for the Zulu.</p>

                    <h4>Strength of the Zulu Nation</h4>
                    <p>The Zulu nation's growth and strength was based on its military organization and skills during
                         Shaka's reign and that of his successors. The military was organized around the ukubuthwa ('to
                         be enrolled') system, which did away with initiation ceremonies for the most part. Each
                         age-set, or group of young men of the same age, was assigned to the same regiment - ibutho
                         singular, amabutho plural - according to the system. Girls were also subject to Ukubuthwa, but
                         they were usually assigned to an age group rather than a regiment. The amabutho were housed in
                         military barracks - ikhanda singular, amakhanda plural - located throughout the kingdom and
                         under the command of a close relative or someone appointed by the king.

                         The barracks were designed and laid out similarly to an umuzi, but on a much larger scale.
                         Aside from military duties, the izinsizwa 'young men' were also responsible for the repair and
                         maintenance of their barracks.</p>

                    <h4>Kingdom</h4>
                    <p>
                         The Zulu formed a powerful state in 1816 under the leader Shaka. Shaka, as the Zulu
                         commander of the Mthethwa Empire and successor to Dingiswayo, united what was once a
                         confederation of tribes into an imposing empire under Zulu hegemony. Shaka built a militarised
                         system known as Impi featuring conscription, a standing army, new weaponry, regimentation, and
                         encirclement battle tactics. Zulu expansion was a major factor of the Mfecane ("Crushing") that
                         depopulated large areas of southern Africa. It is during this period when Shaka deployed
                         an army regiment for raiding tribes on the North. The regiment which was under Mzilikazi
                         disobeyed Shaka and crafted a plan to continue raiding up-North forming another dialect of Zulu
                         language referred to as Northern Ndebele (Now in Zimbabwe).
                    </p>

                    <h5>Conflict with the British</h5>
                    <p>
                         In mid-December 1878, envoys of the British crown delivered an ultimatum to 11 chiefs
                         representing the then-current king of the Zulu empire, Cetshwayo. Under the British terms
                         delivered to the Zulu, Cetshwayo would have been required to disband his army and accept
                         British sovereignty. Cetshwayo refused, and war between the Zulus and African contingents of
                         the British crown began on January 12, 1879. Despite an early victory for the Zulus at the
                         Battle of Isandlwana on the 22nd of January, the British fought back and won the Battle at
                         Rorke's Drift, and decisively defeated the Zulu army by July at the Battle of Ulundi.</p>

                    <h5>Absorption into Natal</h5>
                    <p>
                         After Cetshwayo's capture a month following his defeat, the British divided the Zulu Empire
                         into 13 "kinglets". The sub-kingdoms fought amongst each other until 1883 when Cetshwayo was
                         reinstated as king over Zululand. This still did not stop the fighting and the Zulu monarch was
                         forced to flee his realm by Zibhebhu, one of the 13 kinglets, supported by Boer mercenaries.
                         Cetshwayo died in February 1884, killed by Zibhebhu's regime, leaving his son, the 15-year-old
                         Dinuzulu, to inherit the throne. In-fighting between the Zulu continued for years, until in
                         1897 Zululand was absorbed fully into the British colony of Natal.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Apartheid Years</h4>
                    <h5>Zulu homeland</h5>
                    <p>
                         Under apartheid, the homeland of KwaZulu (Kwa meaning place of) was created for Zulu people. In
                         1970, the Bantu Homeland Citizenship Act provided that all Zulus would become citizens of
                         KwaZulu, losing their South African citizenship. KwaZulu consisted of many disconnected pieces
                         of land, in what is now KwaZulu-Natal. Hundreds of thousands of Zulu people living on privately
                         owned "black spots" outside of KwaZulu were dispossessed and forcibly moved to bantustans -
                         worse land previously reserved for whites contiguous to existing areas of KwaZulu. By 1993,
                         approximately 5.2 million Zulu people lived in KwaZulu, and approximately 2 million lived in
                         the rest of South Africa. The Chief Minister of KwaZulu, from its creation in 1970 (as
                         Zululand) was Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi. In 1994, KwaZulu was joined with the province of
                         Natal, to form modern KwaZulu-Natal.
                    </p>

                    <h5>Inkatha YeSizwe</h5>
                    <p>
                         Inkatha YeSizwe means "the crown of the nation". In 1975, Buthelezi revived the Inkatha
                         YaKwaZulu,
                         predecessor of the Inkatha Freedom Party. This organization was nominally a protest movement
                         against
                         apartheid, but held more conservative views than the ANC. For example, Inkatha was opposed to
                         the
                         armed struggle, and to sanctions against South Africa. Inkatha was initially on good terms with
                         the
                         ANC, but the two organizations came into increasing conflict beginning in 1976 in the aftermath
                         of
                         the Soweto Uprising.
                    </p><br>

                    <h3>Language</h3>
                    <p>
                         The language of the Zulu people is "isiZulu", a Bantu language; more specifically, part of the
                         Nguni subgroup. Zulu is the most widely spoken language in South Africa, where it is an
                         official language. More than half of the South African population are able to understand it,
                         with over 9 million first-language and over 15 million second-language speakers. Many Zulu
                         people also speak Xitsonga, Sesotho and others from among South Africa's 11 official languages.
                    </p><br>

                    <h3>Ceremony</h3>
                    <h4>Umhlanga</h4>
                    <p>
                         The Zulu people celebrate an annual event that was established in 1984 called the Umhlanga or
                         Reed Dance. This event takes place at the royal capital near Nongoma. This traditional
                         ceremony is performed by young women from all parts of the kingdom to perform in front of the
                         monarch and his guests. The purpose of this event is to promote pride in virginity and to
                         restrain sexual relationships. Beadwork is a prominent attire that is worn at the Umhlanga.
                         The beadwork is not only worn by the dancers, but by the guests as well. The Umhlanga is not
                         purely for a time of dance. The King also uses this time to speak to the young men and women of
                         the nation. The King discusses current political issues.
                    </p><br>

                    <h3>Beadwork</h3>
                    <h4>History</h4>
                    <p>
                         The creation of beadwork dates back to the times of war for the Zulu people. This particular
                         form of beadwork were known as iziqu, medallions of war. Often worn as a necklace, the beads
                         were displayed in a criss-cross formation across the shoulders. This assemblage of beads by the
                         warriors represented a symbol of bravery. Before the use of glass was apparent to the Zulu,
                         beadwork derived from wood, seeds and berries. It was not until the arrival of Europeans
                         that glass became a trade material with the Portuguese, which soon became abundantly available
                         to the Zulu.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Purpose</h4>
                    <p>
                         Beadwork is a form of communication for the Zulu people. Typically when one is wearing multiple
                         beads, it is a sign of wealth. The more beads one is wearing, the wealthier they are
                         perceived. The beads have the potential to convey information about a person's age, gender
                         and marital status. The design of the beads often conveys a particular message. However, one
                         must know the context of their use in order to read the message correctly. Depending on the
                         area in which the beadwork was made, some designs can depict different messages compared to
                         other areas. A message could be embedded into the colors and structure of the beads or could be
                         strictly for decorative purposes. Beadwork can be worn in everyday use, but is often worn
                         during important occasions such as weddings, or ceremonies. For example, beadwork is featured
                         during the coming of age for a young girl or worn during dances. The beaded elements
                         complement the costumes worn by the Zulu people to bring out a sense of finery or prestige.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Apparel</h4>
                    <p>
                         Beadwork is worn by all men, women, and children at any age. Depending on which stage of life
                         an individual is in, the beadwork indicates different meanings. Beadwork is dominantly worn
                         when young Zulu people are courting or in search for love affairs. The wearing of
                         decorative beadwork can act as an attempt to grab the attention of someone of the opposite
                         sex. Also, the gifting of beadwork is a way of communicating interest with lovers.
                         During the transition from single to married women, beadwork is shown through a beaded cloth
                         apron worn over a pleated leather skirt. As for older or mature women, beadwork is
                         displayed in detailed headdresses and cowhide skirts that extend past the knee. These long
                         skirts are also seen on unmarried women and young marriageable-age girls. Men are more
                         conservative when wearing beadwork. However, when a young boy is seen wearing multiple
                         necklaces, it is a sign that he is highly interested by these gifts from various girls. The
                         more gifts he is wearing, the higher prestige he obtains.

                    <h4>Colors of beads</h4>
                    <p>
                         Various forms of beadwork are found in different color schemes. Typically, there are four
                         different types of color schemes:
                    <ul>
                         <li> Isisshunka - white, light blue, dark green, pale yellow, pink, red, black. This color
                              scheme is believed to have no specific meaning.</li>
                         <li>Isithembu - light blue, grass green, bright yellow, red, black. This color scheme derives
                              from clans or clan areas.</li>
                         <li>
                              Umzansi - white, dark blue, grass green, red. This color scheme also derives from clans or
                              clan areas.</li>
                         <li>Isinyolovane - combination of any colors not consistent with other color schemes. This
                              color scheme is often related to connotations of perfection and charm.</li>
                    </ul>
                    The colors of beads might hold different meanings based on the area that they originated from.
                    It is often at times that this can lead to misrepresentation or confusion when attempting to
                    understand what the beadwork is communicating. One cannot assume that the color system is
                    standard across South Africa. In some areas, the color green symbolizes jealousy in a certain
                    area, but in another area it symbolizes grass. One must know the origin of the beadwork in
                    order to interpret the message correctly.

                    <h3>Clothing</h3>
                    <p>
                         Zulus wear a variety of attire, both traditional for ceremonial or culturally celebratory
                         occasions, and modern westernized clothing for everyday use. The women dress differently
                         depending on whether they are single, engaged, or married. The men wore a leather belt with two
                         strips of hide hanging down front and back.
                         <br><br>
                         In South Africa, the miniskirt has existed since pre-colonial times. In the African cultures,
                         such as the Basotho, the Batswana, the Bapedi, the Amaswati and the AmaZulu, women wore
                         traditional miniskirts as cultural attire. These skirts are not seen as shameless but used
                         to cover the women's genitals. The skirts are called isigcebhezana and are essential in Zulu
                         ceremonies. For example, Umemulo is a ceremony for women who turn 21 years of age. It
                         represents a huge transition in the woman's life because it is a symbol of her being ready to
                         accept a boyfriend and even get married. Additionally, each stage of a Zulu's life is
                         determined by a specific type of clothing. For an unmarried woman, she wears the skirt and
                         nothing on the top, but as she grows up, the woman starts to cover up her body because a time
                         will come in which she will be a married woman and an old woman. Nonetheless, a special type of
                         clothing is reserved to pregnant women. When a woman is pregnant she wears an ‘isibamba', a
                         thick belt made from dried grass, covered with glass or plastic beadwork, to support her
                         swelling stomach and its additional weight.
                    </p><br>


                    <h3>Societal roles</h3>
                    <h4>Men</h4>
                    <p>The Zulu people govern under a patriarchal society. Men are the head of the household and
                         seen as authoritative figures. Zulu men identify themselves with great pride and dignity. They
                         also compare themselves to qualities of powerful wild animals such as bulls, lions and
                         elephants. The men contribute to society by acting as defenders, hunters, and lovers. The
                         Zulu men are also in charge of herding the cattle, educating themselves on the lives of
                         disciplined warriors, creating weapons, and learning the art of stick fighting.</p>

                    <h4>Stick fighting</h4>
                    <p>
                         The art of stick fighting is a celebration of manhood for Zulu men. These men can begin to
                         learn this fighting art form as young as the age of five years old. There are multiple
                         reasons why men learn how to stick fight. For example, men may want to learn so that they can
                         set right any wrongs or insults made towards them. Other reasons some men choose to learn
                         are for sporting purposes, proving skills or manliness, and self-defense. The goal of stick
                         fighting is to injure the opponent and sometimes even kill. There are rules of etiquette
                         that must be abided by when stick fighting. The men can only fight a man the same age as them.
                         One cannot hit the opponent when they lose their stick. Only sticks are allowed when
                         fighting.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Women</h4>
                    <p>The women in Zulu society often perform domestic chores such as cleaning, raising children,
                         collecting water and firewood, laundry, tending to crops, cooking, and making clothes. Women
                         can be considered as the sole income-earner of the household. A woman's stages of life lead up
                         to the goal of marriage. As a woman approaches puberty, she is known as a tshitshi. A tshitshi
                         reveals her singleness by wearing less clothing. Single women typically do not wear clothing to
                         cover their head, breasts, legs and shoulders. Engaged women wear hairnets to show their
                         marital status to society and married women cover themselves in clothing and headdresses.
                         Also, women are taught to defer to men and treat them with great respect. The women are always
                         bound by a male figure.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Religion and beliefs</h4>
                    <p>
                         Most Zulu people state their beliefs to be Christian. Some of the most common churches to which
                         they belong are African Initiated Churches, especially the Zion Christian Church, Nazareth
                         Baptist Church and United African Apostolic Church, although membership of major European
                         Churches, such as the Dutch Reformed, Anglican and Catholic Churches are also common.
                         Nevertheless, many Zulus retain their traditional pre-Christian belief system of ancestor
                         worship in parallel with their Christianity.
                         <br><br>
                         Traditional Zulu religion includes belief in a creator God (uNkulunkulu) who is above
                         interacting in day-to-day human life, although this belief appears to have originated from
                         efforts by early Christian missionaries to frame the idea of the Christian God in Zulu
                         terms. Traditionally, the more strongly held Zulu belief was in ancestor spirits (amaThongo
                         or amaDlozi), who had the power to intervene in people's lives, for good or ill. This
                         belief continues to be widespread among the modern Zulu population.
                         <br><br>
                         Traditionally, the Zulu recognize several elements to be present in a human being: the physical
                         body (inyama yomzimba or umzimba); the breath or life force (umoya womphefumulo or umoya); and
                         the "shadow," prestige, or personality (isithunzi). Once the umoya leaves the body, the
                         isithunzi may live on as an ancestral spirit (idlozi) only if certain conditions were met in
                         life. Behaving with ubuntu, or showing respect and generosity towards others, enhances
                         one's moral standing or prestige in the community, one's isithunzi. By contrast, acting in
                         a negative way towards others can reduce the isithunzi, and it is possible for the isithunzi to
                         fade away completely.
                         <br><br>
                         In order to appeal to the spirit world, a diviner (sangoma) must invoke the ancestors through
                         divination processes to determine the problem. Then, a herbalist (inyanga) prepares a mixture
                         (muthi) to be consumed in order to influence the ancestors. As such, diviners and herbalists
                         play an important part in the daily lives of the Zulu people. However, a distinction is made
                         between white muthi (umuthi omhlope), which has positive effects, such as healing or the
                         prevention or reversal of misfortune, and black muthi (umuthi omnyama), which can bring illness
                         or death to others, or ill-gotten wealth to the user. Users of black muthi are considered
                         witches, and shunned by the society.
                         <br><br>
                         Christianity had difficulty gaining a foothold among the Zulu people, and when it did it was in
                         a syncretic fashion. Isaiah Shembe, considered the Zulu Messiah, presented a form of
                         Christianity (the Nazareth Baptist Church) which incorporated traditional customs.
                         <br><br>
                         Furthermore, Zulu people also practice a ceremony called Ukweshwama. The killing of the bull is
                         part of Ukweshwama, an annual ceremony that celebrates a new harvest. It is a day of prayer
                         when Zulus thank their creator and their ancestors. By tradition, a new regiment of young
                         warriors is asked to confront a bull to prove its courage, inheriting the beast's strength as
                         it expires. It is believed this power then transfers to the Zulu king
                    </p>

                    <h4>Bride wealth</h4>
                    <p>
                         Zulu people have a system called ilobolo. This term is particularly used by Zulu people when it
                         comes to bride wealth. Every African ethnic group has different requirements when it comes to
                         bride wealth. In pre-capitalist Zulu society, ilobolo was inextricably linked to the ownership
                         of cattle. During that time, there was not a fixed number of cattle required for the
                         wedding to happen; it could be paid before the marriage or during the marriage. The groom takes
                         the cattle from his father's herd in order to perpetuate the family heritage. Nonetheless, this
                         ritual has changed during colonization because in 1869, Theophilus Shepstone, then Natal
                         Secretary for Native Affairs, formalized the ilobolo payment to 10 cattle for commoners (plus
                         the ingquthu cow for the mother), 15 for hereditary chief siblings and 20-plus for the
                         daughters of a chief.
                         <br><br>
                         They found it too lenient to let the groom give whatever amount he
                         wants, so they decided to establish a specific number of cattle that would be needed before or
                         at the start of the marriage. This has been accepted by Zulu men who were educated in mission
                         schools, but according to more ritual people this became “untraditional”. Additionally, with
                         the instauration of the Natal Code, some Zulu men decided to settle another way in which they
                         could decrease the ilobo: offer a token payment or bring a present for the father of the
                         prospective bride in order to decrease the ilobolo amount to be paid. The payment of
                         ilobolo can be difficult for some families, but as it is often considered a symbol of pride and
                         respect, many are willing to maintain this tradition as long as possible.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Zulu calendar</h3>
                    <p>
                         The Zulu calendar is the traditional lunar calendar used by the Zulu people of South Africa.
                         Its new year begins at the new moon of July in the Gregorian calendar.

                         The Zulu calendar is divided into two seasons, the rainy season uNyaka and the dry season
                         ubuSika. The lunar seasonal calendar has 13 months that do not correspond to the months
                         of the Gregorian calendar.

                         Twelve of the lunar months (inyanga) of the Zulu calendar have around 28 days. Zulu names
                         for the lunar months are based on observations of nature and seasonal activities. A 13th
                         intercalary month (iNdida) lasts four to five days.

                         According to Keith Snedegar, consensus was used to settle arguments over the correct month,
                         which arose around every three years when the 12 lunar months failed to correspond to their
                         natural markers. The extra month was sometimes referred to as Ndid'amDoda (the month that
                         puzzles people). Scottish Free Kirk missionary James Macdonald wrote that the confusion was
                         settled with heliacal rising of Pleiades, which is associated with the month of uNhlangulana.

                    <h3>Umkhosi Wokweshwama</h3>
                    <p>
                         Umkhosi Wokweshwama [um̩kʰoːsi woɠʷeʃʷaːma] ("first fruits festival"), recently also known as
                         Umkhosi Woselwa [um̩kʰoːsi woseːlʷa] ("calabash festival"), is the annual harvest festival of
                         the Zulu people, observed around the December solstice. It takes place at the Enyokeni Royal
                         Palace in Nongoma, KwaZulu-Natal, and is presided over by the Zulu King, who conducts a tasting
                         ceremony as sacred king, closed by the dashing of a calabash to signify that the people may now
                         enjoy the fruits of the harvest; this role was historically expanded by Shaka to have more
                         military significance with a muster and parade.
                         <br><br>
                         It was revived by the current king's father, the late King Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu in
                         1990, after a ban by British
                         colonial authorities following the 1879 Battle of Isandlwana and Zulu defeat in the Anglo-Zulu
                         War (the last was held in winter 1877–78, though some claim continuity as a less elaborate
                         event).
                         <br><br>
                         The festival has mass participation by young men, as Umkhosi woMhlanga has by young women.
                         There is a black bull sacrifice in the king's kraal as the young men work together to kill the
                         animal without weapons, which was the subject of a failed lawsuit by South African animal
                         rights activists in 2009. The sacrifice of the bull is seen as transferring the
                         bull's power to the king. The iNkatha was also renewed. The Scottish mythographer James
                         George Frazer speculated that this reflected an ancient practice of sacrificing the king
                         himself.
                         <br><br>
                         The Kingdom of Swaziland's counterpart event is Incwala, part of a larger family of Nguni First
                         Fruit traditions. Aspects of the festival have been adapted by the Zulu-initiated Nazareth
                         Baptist Church in its celebration of Christmas. The Zulu festival was a partial inspiration
                         for the modern African-American holiday of Kwanzaa.
