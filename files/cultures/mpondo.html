                <h3>Mpondo people</h3>
                <p>
                    The AmaMpondo or simply the Mpondo Kingdom, is one of the Xhosa sub-kingdoms in what is now the
                    Eastern Cape. Having been established around 500AD, the Xhosa clans who were under the rule of
                    King Mpondo kaNjanya and later the 'amaNyawuza' clan (royal clan of the amaMpondo), by nationality
                    referred to themselves as 'AmaMpondo'. Since the founding of the Xhosa Paramouncy around the
                    13th-century, the Mpondo state has been tributary to the amaTshawe.
                </p><br>

                <h3>Origins</h3>
                <p>
                    The story of the origins of emaMpondweni was told to personify and symbolise the fact that it was a
                    nation with lands shaped like a horn, when it includes the lands emaMpondomiseni, and to make it
                    easier for telling Iintsomi, meaning educative stories. Taking Mpondo as the son since it was used
                    for defending and Mpondomise as the daughter since it was used for attacking and negotiation. Thus
                    according to the Mpondo oral tradition, they are the legendary descendants of Mpondo, the grandson
                    of Sibiside who was the leader of the once-powerful Mbo nation (AbaMbo or MaMbo). Mpondo people are
                    part of AbaMbo group who are thought to have migrated from the Great Lakes into modern-day South
                    Africa or the race of people coming from Ethiopia and along Zambia down past Eswatini, believed to
                    be under the Great Kingdom of Kush. This is evident from the ruling plant in the coast south-east of
                    Africa and north-west of Madagascar, the marijuana plant. It grows in abundance from emaMpondweni up
                    the coast and the coast of Madagascar. It is through king Sibiside that Mpondo the forefather of the
                    nation emerges together with other well-known nations. Mpondo people share a common lineage with
                    AmaMpondomise, AmaXesibe, AbakwaMkhize, AmaBomvu and AmaBomvana. <br><br>

                    Sibiside's offspring:
                </p>


                <ol>
                    <li>Mavovo (Sibiside's heir and father of the Mkhize clan)</li>
                    <li>Gubhela (his descendants also call themselves abakwaMkhize)</li>
                    <li>Nomafu (AmaBomvu and AmaBomvana)</li>
                    <li>Njanya (AmaMpondo, AmaMpondomise, AmaXesibe)</li>
                </ol><br><br>
                <p>
                    Mpondo and Mpondomise were twins. There is an ongoing argument about the twin who was the eldest,
                    the
                    most commonly held view is that Mpondo is the senior twin. It is said that while out hunting, Mpondo
                    killed a lion and refused to hand over the skin to Mpondomise as was the custom (the senior was
                    entitled
                    to skins of certain animals). The tension between the two started from that day and Mpondo and his
                    followers were the first ones to leave and settle elsewhere away from their father's land.
                </p><br>

                <h3>Kingdom</h3>
                <p>
                    The great house of Mpondo is called Qawukeni and is situated in Lusikisiki, Eastern Cape. The
                    right-hand house is called Nyandeni and is situated in Libode, Eastern Cape. The Nyandeni house
                    enjoyed autonomy for decades and was often referred to as Western Mpondoland, while the Qawukeni
                    house was referred to as Eastern Mpondoland.
                    The towns in the Mpondo kingdom include Lusikisiki, Siphaqeni (known as Flagstaff), Mbizana
                    (erroneously called Bizana), Ntabankulu, Port St. Johns, Libode and Ngqeleni.
                    Mzintlava (now known as Kokstad) was allotted to Adam Kok of the Griquas

                <h4>Genealogy of kings</h4>
                <p>
                    The most prominent of all kings of the Mpondo nation is Faku (1780–1867); he resided in Qawukeni as
                    it's still the tradition today. The Nyandeni house was established by Ndamase, Faku's right-hand son
                    and a prominent general of the Mpondo army during the Mfecane wars.

                </ul>

                <p>
                    King Cabe was the first king of the Mpondo nation to cross the Mtamvuna River and settled in
                    Siphaqeni. King Ngqungqushe's mother was the first woman whose "ikhazi" (dowry) was paid for by the
                    kingdom, which makes King Ngqungqushe the first "kumkani" in the modern sense. <br><br>

                    King Sigcau is known for his militancy in his fight against colonial rule and imposition of colonial
                    policies, notably the hut taxes in the Mpondo Kingdom. He was later arrested for these actions
                    and incarcerated in Robben Island. He remains a hero to the Mpondo people and admired for his
                    bravery. King Sigcau Bravery Award was launched in his honour. His son King Marelane would become
                    one of the founding Kings of the oldest political party in Africa the African National Congress in
                    1912 in support of the fight against colonial rule in South Africa. His grandson Nkosi Ntsikayezwe
                    Sigcau would follow in the footsteps of his forefathers and become an ANC liberation activist,
                    contributing in the struggle for liberation in South Africa. This also saw him arrested and harassed
                    for his political activities.

                <h3>Mpondo clans and tributary clans</h3>
                <p>
                    There are three types of clans you find in Mpondoland (kwa-Mpondo/emaMpondweni) today. First, there
                    clans that arise out of the many houses of the Kings listed in the section above (Mpondo's
                    descendants). Secondly, there are clans of the older AbaMbo/MaMbo tribe from which Mpondo himself
                    was born out, therefore these are people of his ancestors. Thirdly, there are clans/tribes who have
                    immigrated to Mpondoland and now pay tribute to the Mpondo kingdom.
                    <br><br>
                    In more detail:

                    left their tribes/kingdoms having been given land by Mpondo Kings and thus recognised as forming
                    part of AmaMpondo Kingdom and paying tribute to Mpondo Kings. <br>

                <h3>Causes</h3>
                <p>
                    There were varying reasons that led to the revolts notably the land rehabilitation programme, the
                    Bantu Authorities System and the increase in taxes.
                </p>
                <h4>The land rehabilitation programme</h4>
                <p>
                    The land rehabilitation programme was a system that entailed the colonisers keeping the fertile
                    soils to themselves and allocating the less fertile lands to the local people. The Mpondo people
                    revolted against this.
                </p>
                <h4>The Bantu Authorities System</h4>
                <p>
                    This system brought about tension between the people of Pondoland and their chiefs. The Bantu
                    Authorities System created a pseudo sense of power as colonial authorities gave chiefs limited
                    power, ensuring that administrative duties were still being assigned to the colonial government.
                    This disrupted the system as people were used to being consulted at the Inkundla before decisions
                    were made. Inkundla was when members of a community met together to discuss issues affecting the
                    district/area and made decisions.
                </p>
                <h4>Series of events leading to the 1960 revolts</h4>
                <p>
                    The first signs of revolt were apparent through local vigilante groups such as the Makhuluspani. The
                    Makhuluspani was a group that was created in a bid to combat stock theft in the districts of Tsolo
                    and Qumbu in the 1950s. It is reported that these groups targeted headmen and chiefs who were
                    cooperating or suspected to be cooperating with the colonial government. There were also
                    conflicts around the Bizana area during that same year as the government intended to fence off a
                    certain area on the coastal area to reserve the forests and coastal zones without having consulted
                    the people of Pondoland. People were evicted out of their land, and at one stage during evictions
                    police were attacked.
                    <br><br>
                    In 1959, in the Bizana district, Saul Mabude who was the chairman of the district authority and
                    advocate for the Bantu Authorities system was asked to meet with the people of that community. He
                    was tasked with explaining the Bantu Authorities system to them, however he did not show up as he
                    feared for his life. The consequence to his actions resulted in him having his house burnt and the
                    police terrorizing the people in that area. This did not deter the Pondo people from mobilising
                    against the government, who made it clear to Chief Sigcau, who was the King at the time that the
                    Bantu system was not going to be enforced on their watch.
                    <br><br>
                    In June 1960 a meeting was called at Ngquza Hill. These meetings had become the norm during the
                    apartheid era around that area as people used them to educate each other on the events that were
                    taking place, thus the meetings on the hill were not held secretly. The police were tipped about the
                    meeting, who in turn upon their arrival fired on the people at the hill. This resulted in the arrest
                    of 23 people and the death of 11 people. In retaliation, there was an ambush on a police patrol
                    in Flagstaff. These people were shot at by the police, resulting in the injury of two policemen and
                    the arrest of one headman.
                    <br><br>
                    In November 1960 in Flagstaff, a mass meeting was called at Ngqanduli. Chief Vukayibambe called the
                    police and helped disperse the meeting. One of the protesters was killed, this resulting in
                    Vukayibambe's kraal being set on fire and his death. All those who had an affiliation with the chief
                    and supported him were killed, injured and their kraals set alight. The police were sent to defuse
                    the situation.
                </p>

                <h4>Stabilisation of the revolts</h4>
                <p>
                    A commission of inquiry was held right after the massacre. The demands from the people of Pondoland
                    entailed the Bantu Authorities, Bantu Education Acts being withdrawn, the relief from taxes.
                    Their demands were not met, and in retaliation the Pondo boycotted all white owned stores in
                    Pondoland.
                    <br><br>
                    By the end of November 1960, a state of emergency was declared in Pondoland, in Flagstaff, Bizana,
                    Tabankulu, Lusikisiki and Mount Ayliff. No one could access those areas without a permit, and the
                    west of Umtata was closed off. The revolts were shut down through heavy policing and raiding tax
                    evaders. The Bantu Home Guard was also established by the chiefs in a bid to shut down the revolts,
                    with the aid of the military force that was sent by the state in a bid to subjugate the areas in
                    Pondoland where the revolts had occurred till 1963.
                    <br><br>
                    In 1960, a total of 4,769 had been imprisoned during this period of the revolts from 1950 and 1960,
                    and 2,067 brought to trial and it is reported that 30 people were sentenced to death during August
                    and October in 1961.
                </p>

                <h3>Arts and entertainment</h3>
                <p>
                    The Mpondo people are one of the major tribes that produce and consumes the genre of music called
                    Maskandi but the Mpondo people are unique in a performance of ukusina(Nguni dance) and their own
                    traditional dance called "imfene" (baboon dance). This dance(imfene) is performed by young ones and
                    adults of both sexes to the sounds of Maskandi music
                </p>

                <h4>Mpondo Culture and Heritage Festival</h4>
                <p>
                    Mpondo Culture and Heritage Festival is celebrated annually by Mpondo to celebrate their culture and
                    heritage. It is the biggest cultural event celebrated in the Kingdom attended by approximately over
                    20,000 people preceded by the Annual Mpondo Reed Dance. It is held in September of every year at
                    Lwandlolubomvu Great Place, Ntabankulu; palace of the customary head Jongilanga Sigcau. Ntabankulu
                    is the mountainous part of the Mpondo Kingdom surrounded by the great Mzimvubu River. Ntabankulu in
                    Mpondo language means 'Big Mountains'. September is important in Mpondo history as it was originally
                    the Mpondo new year in the ancient Mpondo calendars and also two of the Mpondo Kings King Mqikela
                    and King Sigcau were born on this month.
                    <br><br>
                    The Mpondo culture and Heritage Festival also celebrates
                    the roles played by these icons, including the legendary kings Faku, Mqikela, Sigcau, Marhelane
                    amongst others. This events also seeks to promote cultural diversity through sharing of Mpondo
                    culture and heritage with other cultures from South Africa, broader African continent and beyond the
                    oceans. It attracts a lot of tourists, both local and international, and is one of the biggest
                    events in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa.

                <h3>Lunar Calendar</h3>
                <p>
                    According to the ancient AbaMbo people, including Mpondo September is the first month of the year.
                    There are some Mpondo people who recognise the appearance of the Pleiades ("isilimela") to signal
                    the beginning of the year, but it is most likely that this interpretation was adopted from the
                    Xhosa people. Mpondo calendar is as follows commencing with uMphanda the first month of the year
                    according to the ancient Mpondo Calendar.

                <p>Faku kaNgqungqushe, son of Ngqungqushe kaNyawuza was the last ruling monarch of the Mpondo
                    Kingdom in Southern Africa from 1815-1867. During his reign, King Faku consolidated and
                    unified several groups and expanded the territory he had inherited from his father. In 1844, he
                    forged an alliance with the Cape Colony and encouraged British colonization of Natal, thus ensuring
                    his own kingdom would have boundaries that were defined according to Western standards at the time.
                    The kingdom was eventually annexed by the British Empire, became part of the Cape Colony and is
                    today a section of the Eastern Cape province of South Africa.</p>

                <h4>Botha Sigcau</h4>
                <p>
                    Paramount Chief Botha Sigcau (died 1 December 1978) was a chief in Eastern Pondoland, Transkei,
                    South Africa (1939–1976) and later the figurehead President of Transkei from 1976 to 1978. A
                    graduate of University of Fort Hare, Sigcau was an early supporter of the Bantu Authorities in
                    Transkei and was rewarded by the South African government when he was appointed chairman of the
                    Transkei Territorial Authority, the parliament before independence.
                </p>
                <h5>Political career</h5>
                <p>
                    Botha Sigcau was a graduate of University of Fort Hare. In 1939, the government gave Botha Sigcau
                    the chieftaincy over his half-brother, Nelson Sigcau, who the Mpondo felt was their rightful
                    heir. Botha Sigcau was favoured by the apartheid government because they could pay him a large
                    salary in exchange for control of the Transkei. When the Transkei was formed in 1976, Botha Sigcau
                    was appointed the first President of Transkei in Eastern Pondoland, South Africa. Kaiser Matanzima
                    was his elected deputy. The area was granted self-governance under the apartheid regime. The area
                    was known as the Republic of Transkei and it was a Bantustan, an area set aside for members of a
                    specific ethnicity. Botha Sigcau was instrumental in writing the constitution of the Transkei.
                    <br><br>
                    There was popular opposition to Botha Sigcau's chieftaincy because he lacked legitimacy according to
                    Pondo custom. Opposition also arose because Sigcau openly supported the Bantu Authorities and the
                    National Party. There was also widespread corruption in the government appointed tribal courts of
                    Eastern Pondoland, which Botha Sigcau ruled over. In 1958, all the Pondoland districts were invited
                    to send representatives to a large gathering called by the Minister of Bantu Administration and
                    Development Michel Daniel Christiaan de Wet Nel, and Botha Sigcau. In this meeting, both Nel and
                    Sigcau promised to grant Pondo chiefs seats in local government as councillors but, in practice,
                    Sigcau selected councillors from his own friends and supporters.
                    <br><br>
                    Dissent over Botha Sigcau’s leadership as president and chief came to its height during the 1960s
                    Mpondo Revolt. A popular movement of resistance arose among the people, and although meetings
                    were illegal, they were held just the same and attended by thousands of people, who came on foot and
                    on horseback to chosen spots on the mountains and ridges. The demands of the people were: the
                    withdrawal of the Bantu Authorities and Bantu Education Acts; representation in the Republic’s
                    parliament; relief from the increased taxes and passes which hampered free movement; and the removal
                    of Paramount Chief Botha Sigcau. The Pondos discovered that news of their meetings was reaching the
                    magistrate. Drastic action was taken against these informers; huts were burnt down, and many of them
                    were forced to flee from the area.
                    <br><br>
                    On June 6, a massacre occurred when people met to discuss their complaints. Two aircraft and a
                    helicopter dropped tear-gas and smoke bombs on the crowd, and police vehicles approached from two
                    directions. Although it was a peaceful gathering, 11 people died and 23 were arrested after the
                    meeting on a charge of ‘fighting’, and of these 19 were convicted and sentenced. It is reported
                    that Sigcau fired the first shot from the helicopter.
                    <br><br>
                    On 1 December 1978, Botha Sigcau died of a heart attack in Umtata.

                <h5>Family</h5>
                <p>
                    King Botha Manzolwandle Sigcau's daughter, Princess Stella Sigcau, was the senior member of
                    amaMpondo Royal family, was the leader of the Transkei National Independence Party, the first female
                    Prime Minister of Transkei in 1987, appointed in different portfolos after 1994 national elections
                    as a Minister of Public Enterprise from 1994 to 1999, Minister of Public Works from 1999 to 2006 .
                    King Mpondombini Thandizulu Sigcau was the eldest son of King Botha Manzolwandle Jongilizwe Sigcau
                    who succeeded him as a King of amaMpondo in 1978. King Botha Manzolwandle's youngest son was Nkosi
                    Ntsikayezwe Sigcau.
