                    <h3>Southern Ndebele People</h3>
                    <p>
                         The Ndebele are an Nguni ethnic group native to South Africa who speak isiNdebele language.
                         AmaNdebele mainly inhabit the provinces of Mpumalanga, Gauteng and Limpopo, all of which are in
                         the northeast of the country. Although both are part of the larger Nguni ethnic group, the
                         South African Ndebele should not be confused with the Northern Ndebele people of Zimbabwe who
                         are a more recent offshoot of the Zulu.
                    </p><br>

                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <h4>Prehistory</h4>
                    <p>
                         The history of the Ndebele people begin with the Bantu Migrations southwards from the Great
                         Lakes region of East Africa. Bantu speaking peoples moved across the Limpopo river into modern
                         day South Africa and over time assimilated and conquered the indigenous San people in the North
                         Eastern regions of South Africa. At the time of the collapse of the Kingdom of Zimbabwe in
                         1450, Two main groups had emerged south of the Limpopo River: the Nguni, who occupied the
                         eastern coastal plains, and the Sotho–Tswana, who lived on the interior plateau. Between the
                         1400s and early 1800s saw these two groups split into smaller distinct cultures and people. The
                         Ndebele were just such a people.
                    </p><br>

                    <h4>Among the Hlubi</h4>
                    <p>
                         Chief Ndebele was living with his people in the territory of the Bhaca and Hlubi south of the
                         Drakensberg Mountains which they called "uKhahlamba". The capital settlement in this territory
                         was called eLundini. Chief Ndebele had broken away from the larger Mbo group and established
                         his own rule over his own people who would take his name as the name of their nation.
                         <br><br>
                         Jonono, the great-grandson of Ndebele moved north with his people and settled in the area just
                         north east of modern-day Ladysmith in the mountains surrounding the mouth of the Cwembe River.
                         Jononoskop which is approximately 30 km north east of Ladysmith is said to be the burial place
                         of Jonono.
                         <br><br>
                         Jonono was succeeded as "Ngwenyama" which is the title of the King of the Ndebele, by his
                         eldest son Nanasi who legend holds, was resistant to all poisons. One tale tells of how Nanasi
                         feasted on the top of a nearby hill on poisonous fruit only to discover that he remained
                         unharmed by the fruit. Today the alleged site is called "Butiswini" from ubuthi esiswini which
                         roughly means 'a poisoned stomach'. Oral tradition does not tell us why Nanasi was eating
                         poisonous fruit in the first place.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Migration to north of the Vaal river</h4>
                    <p>
                         Nanasi died without issue and so Mafana his brother succeeded him as Ngwenyama. Mafana is said
                         to
                         have lived in the mid 1500s. Mafana moved his people from their lands near Ladysmith moving in
                         a
                         north westward direction crossing first the Drakensberg Mountains and then made an attempt to
                         cross
                         the Vaal River. He was unsuccessful and drowned in the river along with a few others.
                         <br><br>
                         After the death of his father Mafana, Mhlanga assumed the throne and took his people over the
                         Vaal
                         River travelling in a north westward direction finally settling in an area around modern day
                         Randfontein. Mhlanga established a new capitol that was later called eMhlangeni(now known as
                         Mehlakeng), which means Mhlanga's place, and there he stayed with the Ndebele until his death.
                         <br><br>
                         Musi, the son of Mhlanga succeeded his father as Ngwenyama of the Ndebele people. While at
                         eMhlangeni, Musi found the area becoming increasingly hostile from the Sotho-Tswana tribes to
                         the
                         west that had not taken kindly to the Nguni Ndebele settling so close to their borders.
                         Ultimately
                         due the competing of resources, Musi uprooted the Ndebele once again and moved his people
                         northwards
                         crossing first the Jukskei River then the Hennops River. After discovering the source of the
                         Apies
                         River, Musi's Ndebele moved north along its banks through Wonderboompoort and settled in the
                         hills
                         north of Wonderboomkop on both side of the Apies River. Here Musi established two settlements.
                         The
                         first of which "KwaMnyamana" (The Place of Black Rocks) served as a new capitol for the Ndebele
                         and
                         was situated on the eastern side of the Apies river. The second settlement was that of
                         "eMaruleni"
                         (Named for the abundance of Marula fruit trees), which was situated on the western side of the
                         Apies
                         river.
                         <br><br>
                         Here at KwaMnyamana, Musi's Ndebele would establish a thriving homeland for themselves trading
                         with
                         BaKwena and BaKgatla tribes in the west.

                         Musi's people also encountered the indigenous nomadic San people living along the Apies River
                         whom
                         they called "AbaTshwa" which is said to mean "The People who we ignore".
                    </p>

                    <h4>Manala-Ndzundza conflict</h4>
                    <p>
                         Musi was a polygamist and as such fathered many children with many wives. The following are
                         some of Musi's known progeny: Masombuka, also called Sikhosana whose name means "to begin".
                         First born son of Musi's third wife. Ndzundza, also called Hlungwana was the first born son of
                         his second wife. Manala, also called Mbuduma was the first born son of his 'Great Wife'. There
                         was also Mthombeni, also called Gegana, Sibasa, Mhwaduba, Mphafuli, Dlomo and Tshwane, whose
                         historicity is hotly debated with many suggesting he was not the son of Musi but the son of
                         Musi's brother Sekhubatane or even Musi's grandson. There are others who even suggest that he
                         may have never existed at all.
                         <br><br>
                         According to Ndebele tradition, it is custom for the first born son of the 'Great Wife' to
                         succeed his father as ruler over the Ndebele people. The first born of Musi's great wife was
                         Manala. Thus Manala was the rightful heir to the ruling seat of the Ndebele. This did not sit
                         well with Musi's second wife whose son Ndzundza was born first before Manala. Oral tradition on
                         the many details of the following vary from community to community however what is mostly
                         agreed upon is that when Musi was old, he was blind and quite senile. After the death of his
                         great wife he was being nursed and cared for by his second wife. This second wife, sensing the
                         passing of Musi was near, instructed Manala to go out and hunt an 'imbuduma' (Wildebeest) to
                         honour his father in his last days. While Manala was out, Musi's second wife came to him and
                         presented her son Ndzundza as Manala and asked Musi to bestow to Ndzundza the "iNamrhali" which
                         it is said, are magical beads or a magical staff that produce a sound that mimics the cries of
                         a child. This mysterious gift was passed from incumbent rulers to their successors at their
                         death to fortify their rule as the new ruler.
                         <br><br>
                         Alternate oral tradition holds that Musi himself sent Manala to hunt the imbuduma and knowingly
                         bestowed iNamrhali to Ndzundza and instructed him to call an "Imbizo" (Royal counsel) and
                         inform the elders and the people of what had transpired between him and his father. Ndzundza
                         was further instructed to not leave KwaMnyamana at any cost. That if he should leave the seat
                         of power, even having iNamrhali would not be enough to consolidate his power as the new ruler
                         over the people and that his brother Manala would surely uses the forces of KwaMnyamana to seek
                         retribution.
                         <br><br>
                         While it is debated how Ndzundza had obtained iNamrhali, the one consistent fact remained in
                         almost all stories that Ndzundza was indeed in possession of iNamrhali at this point. Ndzundza
                         did not head the warning of his father and fled eastwards with many followers including his
                         brothers Mthombeni and Masombuka . Manala arrived with his hunt to find his father had died and
                         Ndzundza with iNamrhali along with many followers had fled. Manala himself called an Imbizo
                         declaring that Ndzundza had stolen iNamrhali and thus his birthright. He vowed to bring
                         Ndzundza back to KwaMnyamana or kill him.
                         <br><br>
                         Manala with his army pursued Ndzundza and caught up with him at MaSongololo (Zonkolol) Between
                         modern day Cullinan and Rayton. There they fought a battle between two branches of the Elands
                         River. Ndzundza had narrowly claimed victory in this first battle and rather than staying in
                         the area he fled with his forces further eastward. Manala pursued again and again lost to
                         Ndzundza's forces in a battle at the Wilge River. It is said that at this battle, Ndzundza used
                         iNamrhali to cast a magical spell over the river causing it to wash away some of Manala's
                         forces. After this second defeat, Manala retreated back to KwaMnyamana to replenish their
                         provisions and numbers. Manala and his army then continued to chase Ndzundza until they met at
                         the Olifants River were a third battle ensued. Ndzundza allegedly cast the first blow, throwing
                         a spear over the river towards Manala which landed at his feet.
                         <br><br>
                         It was then that oral tradition holds that at the moment Manala had the upper hand to kill his
                         brother Ndzundza, a "long breasted" old woman named Noqoli from the Mnguni family stepped in
                         and scolded the brothers for fighting. She proceeded to call a meeting to mediate peace between
                         the two brothers. The outcome of this meeting was that henceforth there would be two kings of
                         the Ndebele people. Ndzundza would hold Musi's iNamrhali and be recognised as his own king
                         within the Ndebele kingdom, and Manala would continue to rule as the senior king from Musi's
                         capital of KwaMnyamana (Wonderboom) and the Olifants River would be the border separating the
                         two powers within the greater Ndebele Kingdom. The agreement further stated that the brothers
                         may never again fight. That great misfortune would follow the Ndebele people should they
                         transgress the agreement which came to be known as "isiVumelano sakoNoQoli" (Noqoli's
                         agreement). To show their commitment to honour Noqoli's agreement, it was decided that Manala's
                         daughters and decendents would marry the daughters and descendants of Ndzundza and vice versa.
                         This practice would later die out. Noqoli and her descendants were honoured with the title
                         Msiza.

                         This story bears great resemblance to the biblical story of Jacob and Esau which features in
                         The Book of Genesis from Chapters 27 through to 33 telling of Esau's loss of his birthright to
                         Jacob and the conflict that ensued between their descendants nations because of Jacob's
                         deception of their aged and blind father, Isaac, in order to receive Esau's birthright/blessing
                         from Isaac.

                         There has been much debate over the past few centuries about the exact details of isiVumelwano
                         sakoNoQoli. This debate boiled over into a legal feud between Enoch Mabhena Makhosoke II of the
                         Manala and Mbusi Mahlangu Mabhoko III of the Ndzundza over who holds the most senior position
                         in the Ndebele kingdom. The matter was settled with the Nhlapo Commission onto Traditional
                         leadership and claims which in 2010 declared Mabhena as the senior king of the Ndebele.

                         In November 2010, former President of South Africa Jacob Zuma caused controversy when he
                         overturned the Nhlapo Commissions finding and declared Mahlangu to be the senior king of the
                         Ndebele. This was later rectified in 2017, High Court and Makhosonke II was legally entrenched
                         as the senior king of the Ndebele People of South Africa.

                         The remaining sons of Musi all went their separate ways after the Manala-Ndzundza conflict.
                         Mthombeni and Masombuka relocated with their brother Ndzundza to east of the Olifants River.

                         Mthombeni (Gegana) continued on with his people north and settled at the confluence of the
                         Mgoto and Nkumpi rivers in what is today Moletlane. Mthombeni's grandson named Kgabe took a
                         large portion of the descendants of Mthombeni north westward crossing the mountains and
                         settling near the Waterberg Mountains along the Nyl river where their descendants were
                         gradually assimilated into the surrounding Sotho-Tswana groups.
                         <br><br>
                         By the middle of the 19th century, the Gegana had further divided into smaller splinter groups,
                         which spread out across the hills, valleys and plains surrounding present-day Mokopane
                         (Potgietersrus), Zebediela and Polokwane (Pietersburg). These groups were progressively
                         absorbed into the numerically superior and more dominant surrounding Sotho groups, undergoing
                         considerable cultural and social change. By contrast, the descendants of Manala and Ndzundza
                         maintained a more recognisably distinctive cultural identity, and retained a language which was
                         closer to the Mbo spoken by their coastal forebears (and to present-day isiHlubi ).
                         <br><br>
                         Sibasa and his brother Mphafuli moved north into the territory of the VhaVenda and were met
                         with resistance from the Venda.[citation needed] After a considerable conflict the forces of
                         Mphafuli and Sibasa established chieftainships at Tshivhase and Sibasa. Some
                         of Mphafuli's descendents trekked southwards and joined the Ndzundza.
                         <br><br>
                         Dlomo had decided to leave the territories north of the Vaal and go back to the ancestral
                         homeland of the Ndebele in Hlubi territory. Here the descendants of Dlomo established the
                         amaNdebele Clan among the Zulu and Hlubi.
                         <br><br>
                         The descendants of Mhwaduba stayed with Manala at KwaMnyamana for almost seven generations
                         until the onset of a drought in the late 1700s caused one of his descendants, known to the
                         Voortrekkers as "Pete" uprooted his people and settled near Schuinsdraai in Limpopo. After the
                         arrival of Mzilikazi north of the Vaal, the remanents of Pete's people settled among the
                         Masetla BaKgatla and were gradually assimilated as BaKgatla.
                         <br><br>
                         As for Tshwane. It is said by some that he was one of the descendants of Mhwaduba who did not
                         leave with Pete but instead moved south and settled on the northern banks of the Hennops river.
                         Thaba Tshwane nearby bears his name. Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality was named in honour of
                         Tshwane as well as a 3m statue erected in-front of Pretoria City Hall. This has caused great
                         controversy.

                         Manala returned from the Olifants River back to KwaMnyamana with two of his brothers daughters,
                         Mathisi and Ganuganu as consolation for the loss of iNamrhali. Upon Manala's return he buried
                         the body of Musi under the Wonderboom at the base of Wonderboomkop. Following Ndebele tradition
                         would have led the funeral ceremony with his clothes inside out in a practice called
                         "ukuhlanukela". After the burial the new Ngwenyama is announced to the people by the royal
                         praise singer after-which there is a great feast. In the years leading up to Manala's death his
                         people saw relative prosperity at KwaMnyamana.
                         <br><br>
                         Manala was succeeded by his son Ntjhele, who succeeded by his son Magutjhona who was succeeded
                         by his son Mrawu, who was succeeded by his brother Ncagu who served as regent until Buyambo,
                         the son of Mrawu was of age to assume the Manala throne. Buyambo's son Mabhena I who succeeded
                         him as Ngwenyama of the Manala throne expanded the territory of to as far south as the
                         confluence of the Hennops River and the Sesmylspruit and as far north as Marblehall in Limpopo.
                         Mabhena I did however struggle with expansion to the west. Never moving past the Sand River
                         which becomes the Tolwane River. He met respectable resistance from the Sotho-Tswana groups to
                         the west. When the son of Mabhena I, Mdibane, ascended to the throne the Manala had controlled
                         a territory spanning the length of northern Gauteng. This included many large settlements such
                         as KwaMnyamana (The Place of Black Rocks) which served as the Manala Capital, eMaruleni (The
                         Place of Marula Trees), eZotjaneni (The Place in The Grass), KoNonduna (The Place of The
                         Chiefs) and eMbilaneni (The Holy Place).
                         <br><br>
                         Ndzundza and his followers now free to establish their own rule moved to the source of the
                         Steelpoort river and built the first Ndzundza capital called KwaSimkulu "The Great Place"
                         situated approximately 20 km west of modern-day Belfast at the foot of Kwaggaskop. Ndzundza's
                         Ndebele claimed all the lands from the Olifants River in the east to the western banks of the
                         Elands River in Mpumalanga as their new territory.
                         <br><br>
                         Ndzundza was succeeded by his son Mrhetjha who in turn was succeeded by his son Magobholi.
                         Bongwe, the son of Magobholi and great grandson of Ndzundza, ruled in a time where the
                         territory of the Ndzundza became increasingly threatened by raids from the Nguni tribes in the
                         south east and more worry-some the growing Sotho-Tswana peoples in the north. Bongwe thus left
                         KwaSimkulu and established a new capital for the Ndzundza at the base of the Bothasberg which
                         was called "KwaMaza" (The Place of Ash). This new capital proved to be in a more solid position
                         with which to push back the expansion of baKgatla tribes in the north. Bongwe died without
                         issue and was succeeded by his brother Sindeni.
                         <br><br>
                         Sindeni continued his brothers campaigns in the north and defeated both the baKgatla under
                         Moloi and the bakwaNkadimeng. Sindeni was succeeded by his grandson Mahlangu. It is not clear
                         how power was transferred from Sindeni to Mahlangu and what happened to Mahlangu's father who
                         should have ruled before him. Mahlangu attempted to expand the Ndzundza territory both to the
                         north and south but had limited success. Despite this Mahlangu gained significant notoriety
                         from his enemies as a skilled military leader.
                         <br><br>
                         Mahlangu was succeeded by his son Phaswana who was killed in war. Phaswana was succeeded by his
                         brother Maridili who had greater success in war defeating Makuwa baPedi and Makwetla baPedi at
                         eDikeni. Maridili died without issue and so the Ndzundza throne passed onto the next brother
                         Mdalanyana who was killed in war. The throne passed to Mgwezana, son of Mahlangu, who too was
                         killed in battle. After this Mgwezana's brother Dzela. Dzela engaged in an ambitious war to
                         claim more territory for the Ndzundza eastwards and attacked the BoKoni around Lydenburg which
                         they called "eMatjhitjhini" (The Place of The Long Grass). This campaign was not successful and
                         Dzela was killed. The throne then passed to Mrhabuli who was the son of Mgwezana but served as
                         regent for the young Gembe who was the rightful heir of Mgwezana's throne.
                         <br><br>
                         To avenge the death
                         Dzela, Mrhabuli split the Ndzundza force into three armies with his brother Magodongo in
                         command of one force, his young brother and heir Gembe in command of the second and himself in
                         command of the last. The plan was to surround the BoKoni capital and attack from three sides.
                         Gembe and his forces had gotten scared and abandoned his brothers on the eve of battle and
                         fled. Mrhabuli and Magodongo inflicted massive loses on the BoKoni but sustained great losses
                         without the support of Gembe. Mrhabuli was killed in this battle and ultimately it was decided
                         among the "Induna" or Chiefs of the Ndzundza, that Gembe's actions were unforgivable and that
                         instead Magodongo would be named the Ngwenyama of the Ndzundza founding a new dynasty.

                    <h4>Mzilikazi and The Mfecane</h4>
                    <p>
                         Sibindi, the son of Mdibane of the Manala had heard of the arrival of a large Nguni army headed
                         by Mzilikazi Khumalo north of the Vaal sometime in early 1820s. Sibindi at first made an
                         attempt to avoid conflict by offering one of his daughters to Mzilikazi as a peace offering.
                         The exact details of the breakdown of diplomacy between Sibindi and Mzilikazi is not clear but
                         oral tradition tells how Mzilikazi asked Sibindi to lend him a few of his best soldiers to go
                         hunting with. Mzilikazi's men then set upon Sibindis loaned warriors and killed them.
                         <br><br>
                         Sibindi subsequently called for all Ndebele, including the forces of Ndzundza to unite as one
                         and meet Mzilikazi in battle. But Magodongo of the Ndzundza had limited forces to spare, due to
                         his own struggling war against Thulare I of the BaPedi. Thus Sibindi with his uncle Chief
                         Mavula as his second instead of Magodongo, marched towards Mzilikazi's advancing horde and met
                         him as Klipkop, west of Pretoria winning a few initial skirmishes with the traditional praise
                         song of Sibindi singing "Ngushlangu sidabula udaka mhlana abantungwa bawa ubusolokohlo
                         KoSomazabanye". "They drove Mzilikazi's troupes passed 'KoSomazabanye'" Which is modern day
                         Cullinan. Unfortunately Sibindi's luck had run out. Sibindi was killed and the Manala capital
                         of KwaMnyamana was sacked.
                         <br><br>
                         This first set of skirmishes against Sibindi proved to be only a test run for Mzilikazi's
                         conquest of the central Transvaal. His forces had already moved to the area of modern-day
                         Middelburg and established a fortress called "EkuPhumuleni" which means "Place of Rest".
                         <br><br>
                         By 1826, Mzilikazi's forces began assaulting Magodongo's capital of KwaMaza. This, coupled with
                         the death of Sibindi, caused Magodongo to retreat from KwaMaza to a new Ndzundza capital called
                         "eSikhunjini" which means "Hiden by the Animal Skin". Despite Magodongo's best efforts
                         eSikhunjini was racked and Magodongo and his sons were taken captive by Mzilikazi. Tales tell
                         of how Mzilikazi had the still living Magadongo partially impaled on wooden poles to torture
                         him but not kill him. Mzilikazi then killed some of Magodongo's sons one by one by throwing
                         them off a cliff after which he tied Magodngo to a large rock and threw him in a river to
                         drown.
                         <br><br>
                         In December 1826, Mzilikazi had shattered both the Manala and Ndzundza Ndebele and established
                         a new capital for his Mthwakazi empire on the banks of the Apies River near Wonderboompoort and
                         called it "Kungwini" which means "Place of Mist". Mzilikazi would rule from Kungwini for more
                         that 10 years sending raiding forces as far north as the northern banks of the Olifants River
                         and as far south as Heilbron in the Free State.
                         <br><br>
                         The Mthwakazi of Mzilikazi suppressed any attempts by the Ndebele to re assert dominance in the
                         region killing both Salimba's successor Mvula who was his brother, and Mgibe another brother.
                         Among the Ndzundza the throne passed to Sibhoko who was one of the surviving sons of Magodongo.
                         Sibhoko was allegedly killed after a dispute with a Sotho-Tswana Chief named Matlala north of
                         Marblehall. He was succeeded by another of Magodongo's surviving sons named Somdeyi. Somdeyi
                         ruled as regent for Tjambowe who was allegedly next in line to be king of the Ndzundza. Somdeyi
                         was killed by one of Mzilikazi's raiding parties.
                         <br><br>
                         Mzilikazi's occupation of the central Transvaal region would become threatened with the arrival
                         of the Voortrekkers north of the Vaal River in 1836. The resulting confrontations over the next
                         two years caused Mzilikazi to suffer heavy losses. By early 1838, Mzilikazi and his people were
                         forced northwards out of Transvaal altogether and across the Limpopo River. Further attacks
                         caused him to move again, at first westwards into present-day Botswana and then later
                         northwards towards what is now Zambia. He was unable to settle the land there because of the
                         prevalence of tsetse fly which carried diseases fatal to oxen. Mzilikazi therefore travelled
                         again, this time southeastwards into what became known as Matabeleland (situated in the
                         southwest of present-day Zimbabwe) and settled there in 1840
                    </p><br>

                    <h3>Transvaal Republic</h3>
                    <p>
                         Directly after the defeat of Mzilikazi, the lands between the Vaal River and Limpopo were left
                         in tatters and some Voortrekkers settled on lands that had previously belonged to African
                         groups like the Ndzundza and Manala Ndebele. They claimed that upon their arrival the region
                         was almost devoid of any African inhabitants because the thinking went, they had all fled in
                         the face of the Mfecane. The Boers believed that the land was deserted and abandoned and
                         therefore theirs for the taking. This caused great conflict between Boers and African kingdoms
                         of the region who were attempting to reclaim the lands stolen from them by Mzilikazi's
                         Mthwakazi Empire.
                         <br><br>
                         The Manala were hardest hit by Mzilikazi's occupation. After the death of Sibindi the throne
                         went to his brother Mvula who ruled only a year before being assassinated by Mzilikazi's
                         forces. after Mvula the leadership of the Manala passed on to the next brother Mgibe. Mgibe
                         ruled much longer than Mvula and had the foresight to send his brothers and their families to
                         scatter and live far and wide so that if he should die, that there would always be another
                         Manala of Mdibane to take over leadership. Mgibe like many before him was assassinated by
                         Mzilikazi raiding parties after ruling in exile for only 5 years.
                         <br><br>
                         The throne of the Manala would then pass to Silamba who was another son of Mdibane. Silamba
                         attempted to re-establish control over the lands previously owned by the Manala but was met
                         with staunch resistance by Voortrekker settlers. The territories south of KwaMnyamana where
                         occupied, Silamba discovered, by two brothers named Lucas Cornelius Bronkhorst and Johannes
                         Gerhardus Stephanus Bronkhorst who had arrived north of the Vaal with the Trek Party of Andries
                         Hendrik Potgieter. The Bronkhorsts had settled near Fountains Valley along the Apies River. The
                         ruins of their first homestead can be found in Groenkloof Nature Reserve.
                         <br><br>
                         By 1842 Silamba had clashed with the Bronkhorsts a good deal and ultimately lost all the Manala
                         lands south of KwaMnyamana. Silamba lived for sometime in KoNonduna near modernday Tierpoort.
                         In 1873, After the establishment of The Transvaal Republic, Silamba moved from KoNonduna and
                         settled in Wallmansthal and established a new capital for the Manala called "KoMjekejeke".
                         <br><br>
                         Among the Ndzundza after the death of Somdeyi, The throne should have passed to Tjambowe who
                         was the grandson of Magodongo but he had gone from being fully sighted to being completely
                         blind in a span of 6 years and this disqualified him from his claim to the throne. An Imbizo
                         was called and the chiefs and elders of the Ndzundza consulted and the decision was made to
                         make Mabhoko, one of Magodono's youngest sons king. He was chosen for his youth and
                         intelligence and for his bravery in battle despite how young he was. Mabhoko became known for
                         his internal diplomacy skills offering Tjambowe a place of honour at all special events and
                         invited him to live with him in the royal dwelling. Mabhoko had further decided to move the
                         Ndzundza capital from eSikhunjini to a new settlement which he heavily fortified and called
                         "eMrholeni". This new capital was near a series of caves called "KoNomtjarhelo".
                         <br><br>
                         Mabhoko began immediate plans to restore the Ndzundza kingdom. Through diplomacy he entered
                         into an alliance with one of the BaPedi Chiefs of the Marota Empire named Malewa. This alliance
                         with Chief Malewa would ensure the Ndzundza's northern most boarder would be protected. With
                         Silamba's loss of the lands to the west let many settler enter into Ndzundza territory. With
                         the establishment of Ohrigstad in 1845 just 120 km north east of the Ndzundza capital, Mabhokho
                         moved the capital from eMrholeni into the caves of KoNomtjarhelo and established a virtually
                         impenetrable fortress.
                         <br><br>
                         Almost from the onset sporadic skirmishes began to take place between these new immigrants, and
                         the Ndebele-Pedi alliance, who actively resisted the incursions which they were beginning to
                         make upon their ancestral lands. Mabhoko had through the used of trade and raids secured large
                         amounts of fire arms and won many of the initial skirmishes against the Boer forces.
                         <br><br>
                         A malaria outbreak in Ohrigstad caused the Boers to move to deeper into Ndzundza territory and
                         they established a settlement at Laersdrif. The settlement of Boers at Laersdrif which was less
                         that 40 km south of the Ndzundza fortress of KoNomtjarhelo aggravated the Ndzundza into full
                         out war with the Boers. This all came to a head in 1847 when Ndzundza won a decisive battle
                         against the Boers. Many Boers left the area to settle lands in the west and those who stayed
                         were required to recognise Mabhoko's authority and pay a tax in the form of cattle or supplies.
                         <br><br>
                         Tensions between African kingdoms of the Transvaal and White settlers would only worsen with
                         the signing of the Sand River Convention 17 January 1852. This document was signed between the
                         British Empire and the Boers. In this document The British formally recognised the independence
                         of the Boers north of the Vaal River. With this treaty in hand, the Boers established The
                         Transvaal Republic as all the lands between the Vaal River in the south and Limpopo River in
                         the north. The problem with the Sand River Convention was that no mention of or regard was
                         given to the African people already living between the Vaal and Limpopo Rivers. In reality the
                         Boers had only established a handful of settlements by 1852 and the majority of occupied land
                         in the Transvaal was occupied by African kingdoms.
                         <br><br>
                         In 1861, The throne of the Marota Empire fell to Sekhukhune who greatly expanded the lands of
                         the BaPedi and this caused tensions with Mabhoko who resisted. After winning a few key battle
                         against Sekhukhune. Mabhoko ultimately submitted to the rule of Sekhukhune and the Marota
                         Empire. This drove a wedge between the Ndzundza and the BaPedi in the years to come.
                         <br><br>
                         In 1863, tensions between the Boers and the Ndzundza Ndebele rose to boiling point again and
                         The Boers, seeing Mabhoko with his arsenal of firearms as threat to the safety of the Republic,
                         attacked KoNomtjarhelo with the aid of Swazi forces. This attack failed and the Swazi having
                         sustained most of the casualties, deserted the Boers. In 1864 a second assault was made at
                         KoNomtjarhelo and this too failed.
                         <br><br>
                         Despite Mabhoko's continuous victory, the Ndundza territory, like the Manala was becoming
                         smaller and smaller. A year later in 1865 Mabhoko died and was succeeded by his son Mkhephuli
                         who was also called Soqaleni. Mkhephuli ruled for only 10 years and then passing the throne to
                         his son Rhobongo/Xobongo. Rhobongo was not well loved and was described as somewhat of a
                         tyrant. Rhobongo was succeeded by his brother Nyabela in 1879.

                    <h4>Mapoch War (1882-83)</h4>
                    <p>
                         In 1876, The Transvaal Republic under the controversial presidency of Thomas François Burgers,
                         lost an expensive war against Sekhukhune north of the Steelpoort River. This led Theophilus
                         Shepstone to annex the Transvaal on 12 April 1877 on behalf of the British Empire under the
                         pretence of bringing stability to the region.
                         <br><br>
                         This annexation by the British led to The Transvaal War of Independence (1880–81), more
                         famously called The "First Anglo-Boer War". This war resulted in Boer victory.
                         <br><br>
                         In the time of Nyabela's rule, The Ndzundza kingdom comprised approximately 84 km and had a
                         population of about 15,000. It was after the Transvaal regained its independence in 1881 that
                         the relationship between the Boers and Ndzundza began to deteriorate more rapidly than ever
                         before. The Transvaal was becoming annoyed with Nyabela for asserting his independence (by, for
                         example, declining to pay taxes, refusing to hold a census when instructed to do so and
                         preventing a boundary commission from beaconing off his lands). What eventually became the
                         casus belli was Nyabela's decision to harbour the Pedi Chief Mampuru, after he had assassinated
                         his brother Sekhukhune on 13 August 1882.On two previous occasions, the Transvaal authorities
                         had attempted to arrest Mampuru for fomenting disorder, and this latest outrage was the last
                         straw. Mampuru and his supporters sought refuge with Makwani, one of Nyabela's subordinate
                         chiefs. When ordered to extradite the fugitive, Nyabela made the decision not to do so.
                         <br><br>
                         On 12 October 1882, the Volksraad authorised General Piet Joubert to raise a commando. At
                         first, only Mampuru was the target of the expedition, but, at the end of the month, General
                         Joubert was also instructed to bring to heel any African peoples who had harboured or assisted
                         him. General Joubert had allegedly little enthusiasm for his latest brief, but this would not
                         prevent him from pursuing it to its conclusion with relentless thoroughness. Raising enough
                         able-bodied burghers for the expedition was not an altogether easy task. Few relished having to
                         leave their farms for months on end to take part in a dull and prolonged campaign against
                         rebellious Africans, even under a leader as respected and popular as General Joubert.
                         Nevertheless, an expeditionary force was duly raised. The white citizens of the Transvaal
                         Republic had few civic obligations, but serving on commando was one of them, and most of those
                         called out reported for duty.
                         <br><br>
                         By the end of October, the vanguard of General Joubert's commando, which was about ~2 000
                         strong, began arriving in Ndzundza territory. An ultimatum was sent to Nyabela, giving him one
                         last chance to surrender Mampuru and to undertake to cooperate with the Transvaal authorities
                         in future or war would ensue. General Joubert was anxious that he comply as a military campaign
                         was not likely to be an easy one. For one, the Ndzundza Ndebele had in their possession a
                         considerable arsenal of firearms that the Ndzundza had been trained to use in war since the
                         rule of Mabhoko. Secondly, the fortress of KoNomtjarhelo was situated between precipitous
                         cliffs and sheer rock faces on the eastern extremity of a range of heavily forested,
                         boulder-strewn hills. A complex network of caves, grottos and tunnels pockmarked these heights,
                         providing both places of refuge and space for storage to help withstand a long siege. The caves
                         were a remarkable phenomenon, some being so extensive as to enable fighters to disappear into
                         one entrance and reappear from a different one more than a kilometre away. Moreover, to capture
                         the main stronghold, the attacking force would first have to overcome a series of
                         well-fortified hills, most notably KwaPondo and KwaMrhali (called 'Vlugkraal' and 'Boskop'
                         respectively by the Boers; KoNomtjarhelo was simply 'Spitskop') which guarded its approaches to
                         the west.
                         <br><br>
                         Any hopes he might have had for compliance were soon disappointed. Nyabela famously answered
                         that he had swallowed Mampuru, and if the Boers wanted him they would have to kill him and take
                         him out of his belly.
                         <br><br>
                         General Joubert would ultimately eschew direct attacks against these strong points. The Boers
                         were past masters when it came to storming hills (as they had demonstrated at Battle of Majuba
                         Hill and Battle of Schuinshoogte the previous year). In this particular war, they could not be
                         relied upon to take too many risks. Already half-hearted about the coming fight, they were
                         liable to desert or simply refuse to cooperate. General Joubert complained after the war to the
                         Volksraad that the burghers "seemed to prefer looting cattle on their own account to fighting."
                         Instead, therefore, Joubert's chosen strategy was to wear the chiefs down, confining them and
                         their people to their mountain fortresses and allowing starvation to do the rest. This would at
                         least minimise losses among the Boers. On the other hand, it would inevitably prolong the war.
                         It was already known that the Ndzundza were stockpiling their food supplies in anticipation of
                         a long siege.
                         <br><br>
                         On 5 November, a last-ditch attempt to conclude the dispute peacefully came to nothing and, two
                         days later, the first clash of the war took place. Without warning, a Ndzundza raiding party
                         swooped down from the surrounding heights and began driving the commando's oxen, nearly a
                         thousand head, towards a cave in the mountainside. About 150 Boers galloped after the raiders,
                         running them to ground before they reached their destination and reclaiming their cattle. About
                         twenty Ndzundza were killed in the skirmish; the Boers suffered just one, casualty. Within two
                         weeks of the commencement of hostilities, the KwaPondo bastion was already being menaced. Three
                         cannons as well as a considerable amount of dynamite had since arrived from Pretoria to help
                         reduce the defences. On 17 November, the Ndzundza attempted to drive back the besieging force,
                         but were themselves beaten off after two and a half hours of fierce fighting. The Boers brought
                         two of their guns into the firing line during the engagement. Soon after this repulse, Nyabela
                         sent out emissaries to discuss peace terms, but General Joubert was only prepared to deal with
                         the chief in person and sent them back. Nyabela declined to present himself, no doubt
                         suspecting that it was a ploy to capture him.
                         <br><br>
                         KwaPondo, a semi-circular plateau surrounded by cliffs and strewn with boulders, was subjected
                         to a heavy bombardment on 21 November, but to little effect. The Ndzundza forces merely jeered
                         at and taunted the burghers from the safety of their breastworks. General Joubert's dynamiting
                         operations were also unsuccessful, since the warriors of the Ndzundza had taken refuge in caves
                         that were in most cases too deep for the blasts to have much effect. Laying the charges was
                         also a dangerous business. The commando was substantially reinforced in the last week of
                         November, many of the new arrivals being drawn from friendly African tribes in the northern and
                         eastern parts of the Republic. In early December, part of the force was deployed against
                         Mampuru. Accompanying the Boers were a large number of Pedi, who had been loyal to the late
                         Sekhukhune and were eager to avenge his murder. On 7 December, this combined force launched a
                         determined assault, only to retreat in some confusion in the face of an unexpected, well
                         coordinated counter-attack by over 600 of the Ndzundza. Two days later in an early morning
                         raid, dozens of Ndzundza were driven into a cave and all but six of them were shot or
                         asphyxiated in the course of being smoked out.
                         <br><br>
                         Two days into the new year, the commandos attacked KwaMrhali (Boskop) and eventually took it
                         after a fierce firefight. On 5 February, General Joubert mustered his forces for a determined
                         second assault on KwaPondo, which had withstood the besiegers for three months. The battle
                         began just before daybreak and raged all morning. The burghers and their African auxiliaries,
                         in the teeth of a stubborn resistance, were forced to clear the stronghold ledge by ledge and
                         cave by cave. Many lay dead and wounded before the fortress fell. The hill's fortifications
                         were dynamited that same day to prevent the Ndzundza from reoccupying the position.
                         <br><br>
                         Now only KoNomtjarhelo was left. General Joubert and his war council ruled out storming the
                         position and decided instead to use dynamite against it. This would entail digging a trench up
                         to the base of the mountain, tunnelling deeply under it and laying sufficient charge to bring
                         it all crashing down. It was indeed a bizarre and tortuous strategy, certainly amongst the most
                         curious ever to have been devised in modern warfare. Digging commenced on 2 March. Unusually
                         heavy rains that season had softened the ground, and after only a week the trench had been
                         brought to within 400 metres of its objective. The diggers were harassed constantly by snipers.
                         The real threat to the Ndzundza by then was imminent starvation. Four months of relentless
                         attrition had seen their once plentiful food stocks steadily dwindled. By early April, all the
                         chiefs of the Ndzundza had submitted to the invaders. Nyabela was promised that his own life
                         would be spared and his people allowed to remain on their lands if he did likewise. He chose to
                         fight on instead, perhaps still hoping, even at that late stage, to emulate his father's
                         achievement of withstanding the Boers.
                         <br><br>
                         Fighting petered out in the closing months of the war. Joubert was content to maintain his
                         stranglehold until the inevitable surrender, receiving constant reports that the besieged
                         Ndzundza were close to starvation. Most of the Boers merely lounged around in their forts,
                         kicking their heels and waiting to be relieved. Some worked on the trench, which at least
                         provided something to do. The Ndzundza harried the diggers as much as possible. In the middle
                         of April, they staged a successful night attack, doing considerable damage and delaying
                         operations by at least two weeks.
                         <br><br>
                         In the meantime, one member of the commando, evidently a Scotsman by the name of Donald
                         MacDonald, had defected to Nyabela. MacDonald proved to be of some use to his new
                         comrades-in-arms. Amongst other things, he suggested to Nyabela to catapult large boulders down
                         onto those working below. This tactic was one of the reasons that the Boers introduced a mobile
                         iron fort to assist them with the digging. About two metres long, with two wheels inside and
                         eight loopholes for firing, clumsy and unwieldy, it at least ensured that work on the trench
                         could continue in relative safety. Shielded by the iron fort, the diggers managed to reach the
                         base of the hill without further mishap. They commenced tunnelling underneath it, but had not
                         progressed very far when they were held up by a bed of rock. Operations were suspended,
                         permanently, as it turned out.
                         <br><br>
                         Even then, the Ndzundza continued to fight back. Early in June, they launched a daring raid on
                         the Boer kraals and netted themselves some 200 oxen, enabling them to hold out a little longer.
                         At the end of the month, they also proved equal to the first and only attempt to take the
                         stronghold by storm. About seventy of the bolder Boers, frustrated by the tedium of the siege,
                         volunteered to rush KoNomtjharhelo and get it all over with. They had climbed to within fifteen
                         metres of the crest when an Ndzundza counter-attacked, hurling down a continuous hail of stones
                         and bullets pitching the attackers headlong down the way they had come.
                         <br><br>
                         On 8 July, Nyabela belatedly decided to sacrifice Mampuru in the slender hope that this would
                         end the siege. The Pedi fugitive was seized, trussed up and delivered to General Joubert, but
                         the offering came too late. The prolonged campaign had cost the Transvaal Republic a small
                         fortune (the Volksraad later estimated the war costs to be £40 766) in addition to many burgher
                         lives lost, and General Joubert was now bent on forcing an unconditional surrender. This came
                         two days later. Nyabela gave himself up, along with about 8 000 of his warriors who had stayed
                         by him to the end. As reparations, the entire Ndebele country was usurped.
                         <br><br>
                         Nyabela and Mampuru were tried in Pretoria and sentenced to death. Mampuru was hanged for his
                         part in the murder of Sekhukhune. Fortunately, Nyabela was had his sentenced to reduced to life
                         imprisonment, he spent fifteen years in captivity before being released. He died on 19 December
                         1902 at eMlalaganye (The Place Where One Will Sleep Only Once), Hartebeestfontein, near
                         Pretoria.
                         <br><br>
                         The post-war settlement imposed by the ZAR was harsh. The amaNdebele social, economic and
                         political structures were abolished and a proclamation on 31 August 1883 divided 36 000
                         hectares of land among the white burghers who had fought in the campaign against Nyabela, each
                         man receiving seven hectares. Followers of the defeated chiefs were scattered around the
                         republic and indentured to white farmers as virtual slave labourers for renewable five-year
                         periods. In 1895, this whole country, now called Mapoch's Gronden, was incorporated as the
                         fourth ward of the Middelburg District.

                    <p>
                         In the Manala capital of KoMjekejeke, Silamba had died in 1892 and the Manala throne moved to
                         his son Mdedlangeni. Like his father, Mdedlangeni made great attempts to resist the expansion
                         of The Transvaal Republic. Mdedlangeni died under mysterious circumstances. Mdedlangeni was
                         succeeded by his brother Libangeni who ruled as regent for Mdedlangeni's son Mabhena II. It is
                         not known when Mabhena II ascended to the leadership of the Manala Ndebele. Mabhena II died in
                         1906 and was succeeded by his son Mbhongo I. Mbhongo I moved from KoMjekejeke to Jakkelsdans
                         and in 1926 bought a farm near Klipkoppies along the Klipruit and established a new settlement
                         called LoDini.
                         <br><br>
                         After Nyabela, The throne passed to Nyabela's nephew Mfene who was the son of Mkhephuli also
                         called Soqaleni. In approximately 1904, Mfene moved from eMlalaganye and bought the farm
                         'Welgelegen' 60 km north east of Pretoria and established what would become modern day
                         KwaMhlanga.
                         <br><br>
                         This site of eMlalaganye, which was on property owned by the Wolmarans family would become a
                         Ndebele settlement called KwaMsiza and was ultimately sold in 1952 to build the Wonderboom
                         Airport. The community of Msiza moved to the Winterveld region north of Mabopane and built new
                         community appearing on road signs and various maps as either KwaMapoch, Speelman's Kraal, or
                         simply as The Ndebele Village. Its residents however, prefer the term KwaMsiza.
                         <br><br>
                         In 1921, Mfene died at KwaMhlanga, and his son Mayitjha I succeeded him, buying his own ground
                         at Weltevreden near Dennilton in the South Central Transvaal, where he constructed
                         KwaSimuyembiwa (eMthambothini). This settlement would later
                         <br><br>
                         On the 3rd of March 1970, The Bantu Homelands Citizenship Act, 1970 (Act No. 26 of 1970;
                         subsequently renamed the Black States Citizenship Act, 1970 and the National States Citizenship
                         Act, 1970) was passed into Law by the Apartheid government. This law was a Self Determination
                         or denaturalization law passed that allocated various tribes/nations of black South Africans as
                         citizens of their traditional black tribal "homelands," or Bantustans. This led to the
                         establishment of the KwaNdebele 'Homeland' in 1977 with Mfene's KwaSimuyembiwa forming part of
                         the new capital Siyabuswa.
                         <br><br>
                         The majority of Ndebele living in this Bantustan were Ndzundza and many attempts were made to
                         have more Manala move into the KwaNdebele homeland. Tensions however would rise when the issue
                         of KwaNdebele independence emerged in the early 1980s came up, as members of the cabinet
                         promised to make the present numerically smaller Manala supreme paramount of amaNdebele on the
                         basis that the land where KwaNdebele was created originally belonged to the Manala kingdom.
                         <br><br>
                         In 1977, three tribal authorities in the Hammanskraal district in Bophuthatswana, the Litho
                         under Lazarus Mahlangu, the Pungutsha under Isaac Mahlangu and the Manala under Alfred Mabena -
                         seceded from Bophuthatswana with the land and people under their jurisdiction, and joined
                         KwaNdebele. These three tribal authorities combined to form Mnyamana Regional Authority, and
                         the Ndzundza Regional Authority formed the South Ndebele Territorial Authority.
                         <br><br>
                         With the establishment of a legislative assembly in 1979, tensions in the agendas of some of
                         the Ndzundza-Mabhoko traditional leaders and their councillors began to emerge. The legislative
                         assembly involved a 46-member body with a six-member cabinet appointed by the Chief minister.
                         All 46 members were nominated by the four tribal authorities. However, once nominated, a tribal
                         authority could not recall a Member of Parliament. Only the assembly itself could remove a
                         Member of Parliament. The Chief Minister also had the right to appoint or remove traditional
                         leaders.
                         <br><br>
                         The creation of the legislative assembly resulted in a shift in the balance of power from the
                         traditional authorities to the legislative authorities made up of appointees. By early 1985,
                         the split between 'traditionalist' chiefs and the legislature became apparent when Lazarus
                         Mahlangu of the Litho Tribal Authority wrote a letter in which the tribal authority stated that
                         it wished to excise itself from KwaNdebele and rejoin Bophuthatswana. Mahlangu was a Ndzundza
                         traditionalist who had seceded from Bophuthatswana in 1977. The reasons given were that the
                         administration of Simon Skosana interfered in 'traditional affairs' and dictated to, rather
                         than consulted with, the tribal authority. A symptom of this subordinate relationship was the
                         desire of the tribal authority to replace its nominated member of parliament with other
                         nominees, as the present Member of Parliament was not carrying out the instructions of the
                         tribal authority. However, once nominated, Members of Parliament could only be removed by the
                         assembly. The tribal authority also complained that it was being ignored by the magistrate and
                         the Commissioner General. In July 1985, Skosana withdrew recognition of Mahlangu as chief.
                         <br><br>
                         In 1994 The African National Congress won the 1994 General election and The Bantu Homelands
                         Citizenship Act was repealed on 27 April 1994 by the Interim Constitution of South Africa. Thus
                         KwaNdebele and its subjects were incorporated into the Republic of South Africa
                    </p><br>

                    <h3>Social and cultural life</h3>
                    <h4>Internal political and social structures</h4>
                    <p>
                         The authority over a tribe was vested in the tribal head (iKosi), assisted by an inner or
                         family council (iimphakathi). Wards (izilindi) were administered by ward heads and the family
                         groups within the wards were governed by the heads of the families. The residential unit of
                         each family was called an umuzi. The umuzi usually consisted of a family head (unnumzana) with
                         his wife and unmarried children. If he had more than one wife, the umuzi was divided into two
                         halves, a right and a left half, to accommodate the different wives. An umuzi sometimes grew
                         into a more complex dwelling unit when the head's married sons and younger brothers joined the
                         household. Every tribe consisted of a number of patrilineal clans or izibongo. This meant that
                         every clan consisted of a group of individuals who shared the same ancestor in the paternal
                         line.
                    </p><br>

                    <h3>Personal adornment</h3>
                    <p>
                         Ndebele women traditionally adorned themselves with a variety of ornaments, each symbolising
                         her status in society. After marriage, dresses became increasingly elaborate and spectacular.
                         In earlier times, the Ndebele wife would wear copper and brass rings around her arms, legs and
                         neck, symbolising her bond and faithfulness to her husband, once her home was built. She would
                         only remove the rings after his death. The rings (called idzila) were believed to have strong
                         ritual powers. Husbands used to provide their wives with rings; the richer the husband, the
                         more rings the wife would wear. Today, it is no longer common practice to wear these rings
                         permanently. In addition to the rings, married women also wore neck hoops made of grass (called
                         isirholwani) twisted into a coil and covered in beads, particularly for ceremonial occasions.
                         Linrholwani are sometimes worn as neckpieces and as leg and arm bands by newly wed women whose
                         husbands have not yet provided them with a home, or by girls of marriageable age after the
                         completion of their initiation ceremony (ukuthomba).
                         <br><br>
                         Married women also wore a five-fingered
                         apron (called an itjhorholo) to mark the culmination of the marriage, which only takes place
                         after the birth of the first child. The marriage blanket (untsurhwana) worn by married women
                         was decorated with beadwork to record significant events throughout the woman's lifetime. For
                         example, long beaded strips signified that the woman's son was undergoing the initiation
                         ceremony and indicated that the woman had now attained a higher status in Ndebele society. It
                         symbolised joy because her son had achieved manhood as well as the sorrow at losing him to the
                         adult world. A married woman always wore some form of head covering as a sign of respect for
                         her husband. These ranged from a simple beaded headband or a knitted cap to elaborate beaded
                         headdresses (amacubi). Boys usually ran around naked or wore a small front apron of goatskin.
                         However, girls wore beaded aprons or beaded wraparound skirts from an early age. For rituals
                         and ceremonies, Ndebele men adorned themselves with ornaments made for them by their wives.

                         Ndebele art has always been an important identifying characteristic of the Ndebele. Apart from
                         its aesthetic appeal it has a cultural significance that serves to reinforce the distinctive
                         Ndebele identity. The Ndebele's essential artistic skill has always been understood to be the
                         ability to combine exterior sources of stimulation with traditional design concepts borrowed
                         from their ancestors. Ndebele artists also demonstrated a fascination with the linear quality
                         of elements in their environment and this is depicted in their artwork. Painting was done
                         freehand, without prior layouts, although the designs were planned beforehand.
                         <br><br>
                         The characteristic symmetry, proportion and straight edges of Ndebele decorations were done by
                         hand without the help of rulers and squares. Ndebele women were responsible for painting the
                         colourful and intricate patterns on the walls of their houses. This presented the traditionally
                         subordinate wife with an opportunity to express her individuality and sense of self-worth. Her
                         innovativeness in the choice of colours and designs set her apart from her peer group. In some
                         instances, the women also created sculptures to express themselves.
                         <br><br>
                         The back and side walls of the house were often painted in earth colours and decorated with
                         simple geometric shapes that were shaped with the fingers and outlined in black. The most
                         innovative and complex designs were painted, in the brightest colours, on the front walls of
                         the house. The front wall that enclosed the courtyard in front of the house formed the gateway
                         (izimpunjwana) and was given special care. Windows provided a focal point for mural designs and
                         their designs were not always symmetrical. Sometimes, makebelieve windows are painted on the
                         walls to create a focal point and also as a mechanism to relieve the geometric rigidity of the
                         wall design. Simple borders painted in a dark colour, lined with white, accentuated less
                         important windows in the inner courtyard and in outside walls.
                         <br><br>
                         Contemporary Ndebele artists make use of a wider variety of colours (blues, reds, greens and
                         yellows) than traditional artists were able to, mainly because of their commercial
                         availability. Traditionally, muted earth colours, made from ground ochre, and different
                         natural-coloured clays, in white, browns, pinks and yellows, were used. Black was derived from
                         charcoal. Today, bright colours are the order of the day. As Ndebele society became more
                         westernised, the artists started reflecting this change of their society in their paintings.
                         Another change is the addition of stylised representational forms to the typical traditional
                         abstract geometric designs. Many Ndebele artists have now also extended their artwork to the
                         interior of houses. Ndebele artists also produce other crafts such as sleeping mats and
                         isingolwani.
                         <br><br>
                         Iinrholwani (colourful neck hoops) are made by winding grass into a hoop, binding it tightly
                         with cotton and decorating it with beads. In order to preserve the grass and to enable the hoop
                         to retain its shape and hardness, the hoop is boiled in sugar water and left in the hot sun for
                         a few days. A further outstanding characteristic of the Ndebele is their beadwork. Beadwork is
                         intricate and time-consuming and requires a deft hand and good eyesight. This pastime has long
                         been a social practice in which the women engaged after their chores were finished but today,
                         many projects involve the production of these items for sale to the public.

                    <h3>Special occasions</h3>
                    <h4>Initiation</h4>
                    <p>
                         In Ndebele culture, the initiation rite, symbolising the transition from childhood to
                         adulthood, plays an important role. Initiation schools for boys are held every four years and
                         for girls, as soon as they get into puberty stage. During the period of initiation, relatives
                         and friends come from far and wide to join in the ceremonies and activities associated with
                         initiation. Boys are initiated as a group when they are about 18 years of age when a special
                         regiment (iintanga) is set up and led by a boy of high social rank. Each regiment has a
                         distinguishing name. Among the Ndzundza tribe there is a cycle of 15 such regimental names,
                         allocated successively, and among the Manala there is a cycle of 13 such names.
                         <br><br>
                         During initiation girls wear an array of colourful beaded hoops (called iinrholwani) around
                         their legs, arms, waist and neck. The girls are kept in isolation and are prepared and trained
                         to become homemakers and matriarchs. The coming-out ceremony marks the conclusion of the
                         initiation school and the girls then wear stiff rectangular aprons (called iphephetu), beaded
                         in geometric and often three-dimensional patterns, to celebrate the event. After initiation,
                         these aprons are replaced by stiff, square ones, made from hardened leather and adorned with
                         beadwork.
                    </p><br>

                    <h3>Courtship and marriage</h3>
                    <p>
                         Marriages were only concluded between members of different clans, that is between individuals
                         who did not have the same clan name. However, a man could marry a woman from the same family as
                         his paternal grandmother. The prospective bride was kept secluded for two weeks before the
                         wedding in a specially made structure in her parents' house, to shield her from men's eyes.
                         When the bride emerged from her seclusion, she was wrapped in a blanket and covered by an
                         umbrella that was held for her by a younger girl (called Ipelesi) who also attended to her
                         other needs. On her marriage, the bride was given a marriage blanket, which she would, in time,
                         adorn with beadwork, either added to the blanket's outer surface or woven into the fabric.
                         After the wedding, the couple lived in the area belonging to the husband's clan. Women retained
                         the clan name of their fathers but children born of the marriage took their father's clan name.

                    <h3>Southern Ndebele language</h3>
                    <p>
                         Southern Ndebele (English: /ɛndəˈbiːliː/), also known as Transvaal Ndebele or South
                         Ndebele, is an African language belonging to the Nguni group of Bantu languages, spoken
                         by the Ndebele people of South Africa.

                         There is also a different language called Northern Ndebele or Northern Transvaal Ndebele also
                         known as isiNdebele seNyakatho or simply siNdebele, spoken in Limpopo in areas such as
                         Polokwane (Bhulungwane), Ga-Rathoka (KaSontronga), Ga-Mashashane, Kalkspruit, Mokopane
                         (Mghumbane), Zebediela (Sebetiela), which is closer to Southern Ndebele.

                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>
                         The Southern Transvaal Ndebele people's history has been traced back to King Ndebele, King
                         Ndebele fathered King Mkhalangana, King Mkhalangana fathered King Mntungwa (not to be confused
                         with the Khumalo Mntungwa, because he was fathered by Mbulazi), King Mntungwa fathered King
                         Jonono, King Jonono fathered King Nanasi, King Nanasi fathered King Mafana, king Mafana
                         fathered King Mhlanga and Chief Libhoko, King Mhlanga fathered King Musi and Chief Skhube.
                         <br><br>
                         Ndebele – Some of his sons were left behind with the Hlubi tribe
                         Mkhalangana – Some of his sons branched north and formed the Kalanga tribe
                         Mntungwa – Founder of the amaNtungwa clan
                         Njonono – He died in Jononoskop near Ladysmith – Surname Jonono is in the Hlubi tribe
                         Nanasi – He died in Jononoskop near Ladysmith – Surname Nanasi is in the Hlubi tribe
                         Mafana – He died in Randfontein (Emhlangeni)
                         Mhlanga – He died in Randfontein (Emhlangeni)
                         Musi – He died in kwaMnyamana (Pretoria)
                         <br><br>
                         King Musi's kraal was based at eMhlangeni a place named after his father Mhlanga, the name of
                         the place is currently known as Randfontein (Mohlakeng) and later moved to KwaMnyamana which is
                         now called Emarula or Bon Accord in Pretoria. King Musi was a polygamist and fathered the
                         following sons, Skhosana (Masombuka), Manala (Mbuduma), Ndzundza (Hlungwana), Thombeni (Kekana
                         or Gegana), Sibasa, Mhwaduba (Lekhuleni) and Mphafuli and others.
                         <br><br>
                         Southern Transvaal Ndebele is one of the eleven official languages in the Republic of South
                         Africa. The language is a Nguni or Zunda classification (UN) spoken mostly in the Mpumalanga
                         Province, Gauteng, Limpopo and the Northwest.
                         <br><br>
                         The expression isikhethu can be loosely translated to mean 'the Southern Ndebele way of doing
                         or saying'. Isikhethu means Southern Ndebele in the same way that sikitsi will mean Swazi and
                         se harona will mean Sotho.
                         <br><br>
                         The language has been severely marginalised over the years. Until the formation of the
                         apartheid Southern Ndebele homeland (KwaNdebele), speaking the language publicly was
                         discouraged. Most Southern Transvaal Ndebele speakers preferred Zulu especially because the
                         latter was learned at school. Today the Southern Ndebele speakers, mostly those who are
                         educated still prefer to use Southern Ndebele as home language for their children and will use
                         Southern Ndebele as a language to communicate with other Southern Ndebele speakers.

                    <h3>AmaNdebele in Zimbabwe</h3>
                    <p>
                         Zimbabwean Ndebele is part of the Nguni cluster and is therefore very similar to other Nguni
                         languages (such as Zulu, Xhosa and Swati) with which it shares a high level of mutual
                         intelligibility. The South African (or Southern Transvaal Ndebele), while maintaining its Nguni
                         roots, has been influenced by the Sotho languages.
