                <h3>Phuthi</h3>
                <p>
                    Phuthi (Síphùthì) is a Nguni Bantu language spoken in southern Lesotho and areas in South Africa
                    adjacent to the same border. The closest substantial living relative of Phuthi is Swati (or
                    Siswati), spoken in Eswatini and the Mpumalanga province of South Africa. Although there is no
                    contemporary sociocultural or political contact, Phuthi is linguistically part of a historic dialect
                    continuum with Swati. Phuthi is heavily influenced by the surrounding Sesotho and Xhosa languages,
                    but retains a distinct core of lexicon and grammar not found in either Xhosa or Sesotho, and found
                    only partly in Swati to the north.
                    <br><br>
                    The documentary origins of Phuthi can be traced to Bourquin (1927), but in other oblique references
                    more than 100 years from the present (Ellenberger 1912). Until recently, the language has been very
                    poorly documented with respect to its linguistic properties. The only significant earlier study (but
                    with very uneven data, and limited coherent linguistic assumptions) is Godfrey Mzamane (1949).
                </p>

                <h3>Geography and demography</h3>
                <p>
                    It has been estimated that around 20,000 people in South Africa and Lesotho use Phuthi as their home
                    language, but the actual figures could be much higher. No census data on Phuthi-speakers is
                    available from either South Africa or Lesotho. The language is certainly endangered.
                    <br>
                    Phuthi is spoken in dozens (perhaps many dozens) of scattered communities in the border areas
                    between where the far northern Eastern Cape meets Lesotho: from Herschel northwards and eastwards,
                    and in the Matatiele area of the northeastern Transkei; and throughout southern Lesotho, from
                    Quthing in the southwest, through regions south and east of Mount Moorosi, to mountain villages west
                    and north of Qacha (Qacha's Nek).
                    <br>
                    Within Phuthi, there are at least two dialect areas, based on linguistic criteria: Mpapa/Daliwe vs.
                    all other areas. This taxonomy is based on a single (but very salient) phonological criterion
                    (presence/absence of secondary labialisation). Mpapa and Daliwe (Sesotho Taleoe [taliwe]) are
                    villages in southern Lesotho, southeast of Mount Moorosi, on the dust road leading to Tosing, then
                    on to Mafura (itself a Phuthi-speaking village), and finally Mpapa/Daliwe. Other Phuthi-speaking
                    areas (all given in Lesotho Sesotho orthography) include Makoloane [makolwani] and Mosuoe [musuwe],
                    near Quthing, in south-western Lesotho; Seqoto [siǃɔtɔ] (Xhosa Zingxondo, Phuthi Sigxodo [siᶢǁɔdɔ]);
                    Makoae [makwai] (Phuthi Magwayi) further to the east; and a number of villages north and west of
                    Qacha's Nek. (Qacha is the main southeastern town in Lesotho, in the Qacha's Nek District).
                    Phuthi-speaking diaspora (that is, heritage) areas include the far northern Transkei villages of
                    Gcina [g/ina] (on the road to the Tele Bridge border post) and Mfingci [mfiᵑ/i] (across the Tele
                    River, opposite Sigxodo, approximately).
                </p>

                <h3>Political history</h3>
                <p>
                    The most famous Phuthi leader in the historical record was the powerful chief, Moorosi (born in
                    1795). It seems that approximately the land south of the Orange River in present-day Lesotho was
                    Phuthi-speaking during the time of the greatest historical figure in the history of the Basotho
                    people, Moshoeshoe I – just seven years older than Moorosi—whose authority in the 1830s, however,
                    was far from covering the present-day territory of Lesotho. Until 1820, there were only "a few
                    isolated villages of Basotho, and a small clan of Baphut[h]i, over which Moshoeshoe exercised
                    ill-defined sovereignty".[5] Most Phuthis, with Moorosi, were far to the south of Thaba Bosiu, south
                    of the Orange River, well out of Moshoeshoe's way.
                    <br><br>
                    Moorosi was to die in unclear circumstances on Mount Moorosi (Sesotho Thaba Moorosi) in 1879, after
                    a protracted nine-month siege by the British, Boer (i.e. Afrikaner farmers) and Basotho forces
                    (including the military participation of the Cape Mounted Riflemen). This siege is often referred to
                    as "Moorosi's Rebellion". The issue that triggered the siege was alleged livestock theft in the
                    Herschel area. In the aftermath of the siege, Phuthi people dispersed widely over what is
                    contemporary southern Lesotho and the northern Transkei region, to escape capture by the colonial
                    powers. It is for this reason, it has been hypothesised, that Phuthi villages (including Mpapa,
                    Daliwe, Hlaela, Mosifa and Mafura—all to the east of Mount Moorosi, in Lesotho) are typically found
                    in such topographically mountainous regions, accessible only with great difficulty to
                    outsiders).
                    <br><br>
                    After the siege of "Moorosi's rebellion", many Phuthi people were captured, and forced into building
                    the bridge (now, the old bridge) at Aliwal North that crosses the Senqu (Orange River). Prior to
                    1879, it seems Moorosi had been regarded in some ways as a very threatening competitor to Chief
                    Moshoeshoe I. Even though currently represented to a nominal extent in the Lesotho government in
                    Maseru, subsequent to the 1879 uprising the Phuthi people essentially fade from modern Lesotho and
                    Eastern Cape history.

                <h3>Classification</h3>
                <p>
                    Phuthi is a Bantu language, clearly within the southeastern Zone S (cf. Guthrie 1967–1971). But
                    within southern Africa Phuthi is viewed ambivalently as being either a Nguni or a Sotho–Tswana
                    language, given the very high level of hybridity displayed in all subsystems of the grammar
                    (lexicon, phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax).
                    <br><br>
                    But Phuthi is genetically—along with Zulu, Hlubi, Xhosa, northern and southern Ndebele, and
                    Swati—certainly a Nguni language. Thus, it should be numbered in the S.40 group within Zone S,
                    following Guthrie's classification. Further, given the range of lexical, phonological and even
                    low-level phonetic effects that appear to be shared almost exclusively with Swati, Phuthi can be
                    classified uncontroversially as a Tekela Nguni language, that is, in the subset of Nguni that
                    includes Swati, some versions of Southern Ndebele, and the Eastern Cape remnant languages, Bhaca and
                    Hlubi.
                    <br><br>
                    The contemporary lexicon and morphology of Phuthi confirms the standard claim (e.g. Godfrey Mzamane
                    1949) that Phuthi displays very heavy contact and levelling effects from its long cohabitation with
                    Sesotho (for a period perhaps in excess of three centuries). There is, for example, a very high
                    level of 'lexical doublets' for many items, for many speakers, e.g. -ciga "think" (Nguni-source),
                    and -nakana "think" (Sesotho-source). Phuthi noun class prefixes are nearly all of the shape CV-
                    (that is, they follow the Sesotho consonant-vowel shape, not the general Nguni VCV- shape).
                    <br><br>
                    There are also regional effects: the Mpapa Phuthi dialect (the only one to retain labialised coronal
                    stops) leans much more heavily towards Sesotho lexicon and morphology (and even phonology), whereas
                    the Sigxodo dialect leans more towards Xhosa lexicon and morphology (and even phonology).
                </p>

                <h3>Phonology</h3>
                <p>
                    Sustained field work by Simon Donnelly (UCT/Illinois/Wits Universities) in 1994–1995 among speech
                    communities in Sigxodo and Mpapa (southern Lesotho) resulted in the discovery of a surprisingly wide
                    range of phonological and morphological phenomena, aspects of which are unique to Phuthi (within all
                    of the southern Bantu region).
                    <br><br>
                    The following phoneme inventory is found in Phuthi:
                </p>
                <h4>Vowels</h4>
                <p>
                    Contrary to other Nguni languages, Phuthi has a 9-vowel system with four different heights. It has
                    acquired a new series of "superclose" vowels /i/ and /u/ from Sotho, while the inherited Nguni high
                    vowels are reflected as /ɪ/ and /ʊ/.

                <h4>Vowel harmony</h4>
                <p>
                    Two vowel harmony patterns propagate in opposite directions: perseverative superclose vowel height
                    harmony (left-to-right); and anticipatory ATR/RTR tenseness harmony, invoking mid vowels [e o ɛ ɔ]
                    (right-to-left). In the first, 'supercloseness'—also a Sesotho vocalic property—in root-final
                    position triggers suffix vowels of the same supercloseness value. In the second, all mid vowels
                    uninterruptedly adjacent to the right edge of a phonological word are lax ([RTR]); all other mid
                    vowels are tense ([ATR]).


                <h4>Vowel imbrication</h4>
                <p>
                    Vowel imbrication is the vowel harmony-like morphophonological phenomenon found in many Bantu
                    languages. Vowel imbrication in two-syllable verb roots is effectively fully productive in Phuthi,
                    that is, -CaC-a verb stems become -CeC-e in the perfective aspect (or 'perfect tense'), e.g.
                    -tfwatsha 'carry on the head' → -tfwetshe 'be carrying on the head', -mabha 'catch, hold' → -mebhe
                    'be holding'. (Cf. examples 9, 11, below).
                </p>

                <h4>Morphological use of vowel height</h4>
                <p>
                    The 'supercloseness' property also active in the first vowel harmony type (above) is active in at
                    least one paradigm of the Phuthi morphological system (the axiomatic negative polarity of the
                    copula: "There is no..."). A morphological use for a vocalic property (here: [supercloseness]) does
                    not appear to be recorded elsewhere for a Bantu language.
                </p>

                <h4>Click consonants</h4>
                <p>
                    Phuthi has a system of click consonants, typical for nearly all Nguni, at the three common
                    articulation points: dental, alveolar, and lateral. But the range of manners and phonations, or
                    click 'accompaniments', is relatively impoverished, with only four: tenuis c q x, aspirated ch qh
                    xh, voiced gc gq gx, and nasal nc nq nx. Swati, by comparison, has clicks at only one place (dental
                    [ǀ]), but five (or even six) manners and phonations. The reduced variety of clicks in Phuthi may be
                    partly related to the nearly total absence of prenasalised consonants in Phuthi, assuming (for
                    example) *nkx, *ngx would be analyzed as equivalent to prenasalized *ng, *nk.
                </p>

                <h4>Tone</h4>
                <p>
                    Either of two surface tone distinctions, H (high) or L (low), is possible for each syllable (and in
                    certain limited cases rising (LH) and falling (HL) tones are possible too). There is a subtype
                    within the L tone category: when a syllable is 'depressed' (that is, from a depressor consonant in
                    the onset position, or a morphologically or lexically imposed depression feature in the syllabic
                    nucleus), the syllable is produced phonetically at a lower pitch. This system of tone depression is
                    phonologically regular (that is, the product of a small number of phonological parameters), but is
                    highly complex, interacting extensively with the morphology (and to some extent with the lexicon).
                    Phonologically, Phuthi is argued to display a three-way High/Low/toneless distinction. Like all
                    Nguni languages, Phuthi also displays phonetically rising and falling syllables, always related to
                    the position of a depressed syllabic nucleus.
                </p>

                <h4>Depressor consonants</h4>
                <p>
                    In line with a number of southern Bantu languages (including all Nguni, Venda, Tsonga and Shona),
                    and also all Khoisan languages of southwestern Africa), a significant subset of the consonants in
                    Phuthi are 'depressors' (or 'breathy voiced'). These consonants are so named because they have a
                    consistent depression effect on the pitch of an immediately successive H (high) tone. In addition,
                    these consonants produce complex non-local phonological tone-depression effects. Swati and Phuthi
                    have similar properties in this respect, except that the parameters of the Phuthi depression effects
                    are significantly more complex than those documented thus far for Swati.
                </p>

                <h4>Tone/voice interaction</h4>
                <p>
                    Significantly complex tone/voice interactions have been identified in Phuthi. This phenomenon
                    results in what is analysed at one level as massive and sustained violations of locality
                    requirements on a H tone domain arising from a single H tone source, e.g. surface configurations of
                    the type HLH (in fact H L* H) are possible where all H syllables emanate from a single underlying H
                    source, given at least one L syllable being depressed. Such tone/voice configurations lead to grave
                    problems for any theoretical phonology that seeks to be maximally constrained in its architecture
                    and operations.

                    The last two phenomena are non-tonal suprasegmental properties which each take on an additional
                    morphological function in Phuthi:
                </p>

                <h4>Morphological use of breathy voice/depression</h4>
                <p>
                    The vocalic property breathy voice/depression is separated from the set of consonants that typically
                    induce it, and is used grammatically in the morphological copulative – similar to the Swati copula –
                    and elsewhere in the grammar too (e.g. in associative prefixes formed from 'weak' class noun
                    prefixes 1,3,4,6,9).

                <h3>Alphabet</h3>
                <p>A Phuthi orthography has not yet been standardised. Donnelly (1999, 2007) uses a proposed alphabet
                    based uncontroversially on that of other Nguni and Sesotho languages: </p>

                <p>
                    There are two superclose vowels, also found in the Sesotho languages. In the Phuthi orthography they
                    are indicated with a circumflex diacritic, thus:

                <ul>
                    <li>î û</li>

                    hl kh⟩, in Swati ⟨dv tf⟩, and in Sesotho ⟨j kg ng r⟩. Symbols in parentheses are allophones of ⟨tf
                    dv⟩. Most (non-labial) consonants can also occur with a secondary labial glide articulation ⟨w⟩,
                    e.g. as ⟨z⟩, so also ⟨zw⟩.

                <h4>Nouns</h4>
                <p>
                    The Phuthi noun (as everywhere in Bantu) consists of two essential parts: the prefix and the stem.
                    Nouns can be grouped into noun classes according to prefix, which are numbered consecutively
                    according to the pan-Bantu system established by Meinhof and modified by Doke. The following table
                    gives an overview of Phuthi noun classes, arranged according to singular-plural pairs.

                    <li>Caveat for the table: as in all Nguni and Sotho–Tswana languages, "Class 8" does not reflect
                        Proto-Bantu Class 8 *bi-; rather, it is a near copy of Class 10, barring Class 10's homorganic
                        nasal prefix consonant. Except in monosyllabic nouns borrowed from Sesotho, Phuthi entirely
                        lacks this Class 9/10 N- – see phrases 6, 7 above. Thus, Phuthi Classes 8 and 10 are completely
                        conflated.</li>
