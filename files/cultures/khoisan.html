                <h3>Khoisan</h3>
                <p>
                    Khoisan /ˈkɔɪsɑːn/, or Khoe-Sān (pronounced [kxʰoesaːn]), according to the contemporary
                    Khoekhoegowab orthography, is a catch-all term for those indigenous peoples of Southern Africa who
                    do not speak one of the Bantu languages, combining the Khoekhoen (formerly "Khoikhoi") and the Sān
                    or Sākhoen (also, in Afrikaans: Boesmans, or in English: Bushmen, after Dutch: Boschjesmens; and
                    Saake in the Nǁng language).
                    <br><br>
                    Khoekhoen specifically were formerly known as "Hottentots", which was an onomatopoeic term (from
                    Dutch hot-en-tot) referring to the click consonants prevalent in the Khoekhoe languages, as they are
                    in all the languages grouped under Khoesān. Dutchmen in the early Cape settlement would ply
                    Khoekhoen with liquor as an inducement for them to perform a ritual dance. The
                    lyric accompanying the dance sounded in Dutch ears like hot-en-tot.
                    <br><br>
                    Sān are popularly thought of as foragers in the Kalahari Desert and regions of Botswana, Namibia,
                    Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Lesotho and Northern South Africa. The word sān is from the Khoekhoe
                    language and simply refers to foragers ("those who pick things up from the ground") who do not own
                    livestock. As such, it was used in reference to all hunter-gatherer populations of the Southern
                    African region who Khoekhoe-speaking communities came into contact with and was largely a term
                    referring to a lifestyle, distinct from a pastoralist or agriculturalist one, and not to any
                    particular ethnicity. While there are attendant cosmologies and languages associated with this way
                    of life, the term is an economic designator rather than a cultural or ethnic one.
                    <br><br>
                    Khoekhoen is an ethnic designator. It refers to several populations which speak closely-related
                    languages and are considered to be the historical pastoralist communities in the South African Cape
                    region, through to Namibia, where Khoekhoe populations of Nama and Damara people are prevalent
                    ethnicities.
                    <br><br>
                    These Khoekhoe nations and Sān are grouped under the single term Khoesān as representing the
                    indigenous substrate population of Southern Africa prior to the hypothesised Bantu expansion
                    reaching the area roughly between 1,500 and 2,000 years ago.
                    <br><br>
                    Many Khoesān peoples are the direct descendants of a very early dispersal of anatomically modern
                    humans to Southern Africa before 150,000 years ago. Their languages show a vague typological
                    similarity, largely confined to the prevalence of click consonants. They are not verifiably derived
                    from a common proto-language, but are today split into at least three separate and unrelated
                    language families (Khoe-Kwadi, ǃUi-Taa and Kxʼa). It has been suggested that the Khoekhoeǁaen
                    (Khoekhoe peoples) may represent Late Stone Age arrivals to Southern Africa, possibly displaced by
                    Bantu immigration.
                    <br><br>
                    The compound term Khoisan / Khoesān is a modern anthropological convention in use since the
                    early-to-mid 20th century. Khoisan is a coinage by Leonhard Schulze in the 1920s and popularised by
                    Isaac Schapera. It entered wider usage from the 1960s based on the proposal of a "Khoisan"
                    language family by Joseph Greenberg.
                    <br><br>
                    During the Colonial/Apartheid era Afrikaans-speaking persons with partial Khoesān ancestry were
                    historically also grouped as Cape Blacks (Afrikaans: Kaap Swartes) or Western Cape Blacks
                    (Afrikaans: Wes-Kaap Swartes) to rather inaccurately distinguish them from the Bantu-speaking
                    peoples, the other indigenous African population of South Africa who also had significant Khoe-San
                    ancestry.
                    <br><br>
                    The term Khoisan (also spelled KhoiSan, Khoi-San, Khoe-San) has also been introduced in South
                    African usage as a self-designation after the end of apartheid in the late 1990s. Since the 2010s,
                    there has been a "Khoisan activist" movement, demanding recognition and land rights from the
                    government and white minority which owns large parts of the country's private land.
                </p><br>

                <h3>History</h3>
                <h4>Origins</h4>
                <p>
                    It is suggested that the ancestors of the modern Khoisan expanded to Southern Africa before 150,000
                    years ago, possibly as early as before 260,000 years ago, so that by the beginning of the
                    MIS 5 "megadrought" 130,000 years ago, there were two ancestral population clusters in Africa,
                    bearers of mt-DNA haplogroup L0 in southern Africa ancestral to the Khoi-San and bearers of
                    haplogroup L1-6 in central/eastern Africa ancestral to everyone else.
                    <br><br>
                    Due to their early expansion and separation, the populations ancestral to the Khoisan have been
                    estimated as having represented the "largest human population" during the majority of the
                    anatomically modern human timeline, from their early separation before 150 kya until the recent
                    peopling of Eurasia some 70 kya. They were much more widespread than today, their modern
                    distribution being due to their decimation in the course of the Bantu expansion. They were dispersed
                    throughout much of southern and southeastern Africa. There was also a significant back-migration of
                    bearers of L0 towards eastern Africa between 120 and 75 kya. Rito et al. (2013) speculate that
                    pressure from such back-migration may even have contributed to the dispersal of East African
                    populations out of Africa at about 70 kya.
                    <br><br>
                    "By ~130 ka two distinct groups of anatomically modern humans co-existed in Africa: broadly, the
                    ancestors of many modern-day Khoe and San populations in the south and a second central/eastern
                    African group that includes the ancestors of most extant worldwide populations. Early modern human
                    dispersals correlate with climate changes, particularly the tropical African "megadroughts" of MIS 5
                    (marine isotope stage 5, 135–75 ka) which paradoxically may have facilitated expansions in central
                    and eastern Africa, ultimately triggering the dispersal out of Africa of people carrying haplogroup
                    L3 ~60 ka. Two south to east migrations are discernible within haplogroup L0. One, between 120 and
                    75 ka, represents the first unambiguous long-range modern human dispersal detected by mtDNA and
                    might have allowed the dispersal of several markers of modernity. A second one, within the last 20
                    ka signalled by L0d, may have been responsible for the spread of southern click-consonant languages
                    to eastern Africa, contrary to the view that these eastern examples constitute relics of an ancient,
                    much wider distribution."
                </p><br>

                <h3>Late Stone Age</h3>
                <p>
                    The San populations ancestral to the Khoisan were spread throughout much of southern and eastern
                    Africa throughout the Late Stone Age after about 75 ka. A further expansion dated to about 20 ka has
                    been proposed based on the distribution of the L0d haplogroup. Rosti et al. suggest a connection of
                    this recent expansion with the spread of click consonants to eastern African languages (Hadza
                    language).
                    <br><br>
                    The Late Stone Age Sangoan industry occupied southern Africa in areas where annual rainfall is less
                    than a metre (1000 mm; 39.4 in). The contemporary San and Khoi peoples resemble those
                    represented by the ancient Sangoan skeletal remains.
                    <br><br>
                    Against the traditional interpretation that finds a common origin for the Khoi and San, other
                    evidence has suggested that the ancestors of the Khoi peoples are relatively recent pre-Bantu
                    agricultural immigrants to southern Africa who abandoned agriculture as the climate dried and either
                    joined the San as hunter-gatherers or retained pastoralism.
                    <br><br>
                    With the hypothesized arrival of pastoralists & bantoid agro-pastoralists in southern Africa
                    starting around 2,300 years ago, linguistic development is later seen in the click consonants and
                    loan words from ancient Khoe-san languages into the evolution of blended agro-pastoralist &
                    hunter-gatherer communities that would eventually evolve into the now extant, amalgamated modern
                    native linguistic communities found in South Africa, Botswana & Namibia (e.g. in South African
                    Xhosa, Sotho, Tswana, Zulu people.)
                    <br><br>
                    Today these groups represent the quantitative majority of extant admixed ancient Khoe-San
                    descendants by the millions.
                </p><br>

                <h3>Historical period</h3>
                <p>
                    The Khoikhoi enter the historical record with their first contact with Portuguese explorers, about
                    1,000 years after their displacement by the Bantu. Local population dropped after the Khoi were
                    exposed to smallpox from Europeans. The Khoi waged more frequent attacks against Europeans when the
                    Dutch East India Company enclosed traditional grazing land for farms. Khoikhoi social organisation
                    was profoundly damaged and, in the end, destroyed by colonial expansion and land seizure from the
                    late 17th century onwards. As social structures broke down, some Khoikhoi people settled on farms
                    and became bondsmen (bondservants) or farm workers; many were incorporated into existing Khoi clan
                    and family groups of the Xhosa people.
                    <br><br>
                    Georg Schmidt, a Moravian Brother from Herrnhut, Saxony, now
                    Germany, founded Genadendal in 1738, which was the first mission station in southern Africa,
                    among the Khoi people in Baviaanskloof in the Riviersonderend Mountains. Early European settlers
                    sometimes intermarried with Khoikhoi women, resulting in a sizeable mixed-race population now known
                    as the Griqua. The Griqua people too would migrate to what was by that time the frontierlands of the
                    Xhosa native reserves and establish Griqualand East, which contained a mostly Xhosa population.
                    <br><br>
                    Andries Stockenström facilitated the creation of the "Kat River" Khoi settlement near the eastern
                    frontier of the Cape Colony. The settlements thrived and expanded, and Kat River quickly became a
                    large and successful region of the Cape that subsisted more or less autonomously. The people were
                    predominantly Afrikaans-speaking Gonaqua Khoi, but the settlement also began to attract other Khoi,
                    Xhosa and mixed-race groups of the Cape.
                    <br><br>
                    The so-called "Bushman wars" were to a large extent the response of the San after their
                    dispossession.
                    <br><br>
                    At the start of the 18th century, the Khoikhoi in the Western Cape lived in a co-operative state
                    with the Dutch. By the end of the century the majority of the Khoisan operated as 'wage labourers',
                    not that dissimilar to slaves. Geographically, the further away the labourer was from Cape Town, the
                    more difficult it became to transport agricultural produce to the markets. The issuing of grazing
                    licences north of the Berg River in what was then the Tulbagh Basin propelled colonial expansion in
                    the area. This system of land relocation led to the Khoijhou losing their land and livestock as well
                    as dramatic change in the social, economic and political development.
                    <br><br>
                    After the defeat of the Xhosa rebellion in 1853, the new Cape Government endeavoured to grant the
                    Khoi political rights to avert future racial discontent. The government enacted the Cape franchise
                    in 1853, which decreed that all male citizens meeting a low property test, regardless of colour, had
                    the right to vote and to seek election in Parliament. This non-racial principle was later abolished
                    by the apartheid Government.
                    <br><br>
                    In the Herero and Namaqua genocide in German South-West Africa, over 10,000 Nama are estimated to
                    have been killed during 1904–1907.
                    <br><br>
                    The San of the Kalahari were described in Specimens of Bushman Folklore by Wilhelm H. I. Bleek and
                    Lucy C. Lloyd (1911). They were brought to the globalised world's attention in the 1950s by South
                    African author Laurens van der Post in a six-part television documentary. The Ancestral land
                    conflict in Botswana concerns the Central Kalahari Game Reserve (CKGR), established in 1961 for
                    wildlife, while the San were permitted to continue their hunter-gatherer lifestyle.
                    <br><br>
                    In the 1990s,
                    the government of Botswana began a policy of "relocating" CKGR residents outside the reserve. In
                    2002, the government cut off all services to CKGR residents. A legal battle began, and in 2006 the
                    High Court of Botswana ruled that the residents had been forcibly and unconstitutionally removed.
                    The policy of relocation continued, however, and in 2012 the San people (Basarwa) appealed to the
                    United Nations to force the government to recognise their land and resource rights.
                    <br><br>
                    Following the end of Apartheid in 1994, the term "Khoisan" has gradually come to be used as a
                    self-designation by South African Khoikhoi as representing the "first nations" of South Africa
                    vis-a-vis the ruling Bantu majority. A conference on "Khoisan Identities and Cultural Heritage" was
                    organised by the University of the Western Cape in 1997. and "Khoisan activism" has been
                    reported in the South African media beginning in 2015.
                    <br><br>
                    The South African government allowed Khoisan families (up until 1998) to pursue land claims which
                    existed prior to 1913. The South African Deputy Chief Land Claims Commissioner, Thami Mdontswa, has
                    said that constitutional reform would be required to enable Khoisan people to pursue further claims
                    to land from which their direct ancestors were removed prior to 9 June 1913.

                <h3>Discoveries</h3>
                <p>
                    In 2019, scientists from the University of the Free State discovered 8,000-year-old carvings made by
                    the Khoisan people. The carvings depicted a hippopotamus, horse, and antelope in the 'Rain Snake'
                    Dyke of the Vredefort structure, which may have spiritual significance regarding the rain-making
                    mythology of the Khoisan.

                <h3>Violence against the Khoisan</h3>
                <h4>Herero and Namaqua Genocide</h4>
                <p>
                    In the Herero and Namaqua genocide, about 10,000 Nama, a Khoekhoe group, and an unknown number of
                    San people were killed in an extermination campaign by the German Colonial Empire between 1904 and
                    1908.

                <h3>Forced relocation in Botswana</h3>
                <p>
                    In Botswana, many of the indigenous San people have been forcibly relocated from their land to
                    reservations. To make them relocate, they were denied access to water on their land and faced arrest
                    if they hunted, which was their primary source of food. Their lands lie in the middle of the
                    world's richest diamond field. Officially, the government denies that there is any link to mining
                    and claims the relocation is to preserve the wildlife and ecosystem, even though the San people have
                    lived sustainably on the land for millennia. On the reservations they struggle to find
                    employment, and alcoholism is rampant.
                </p><br>

                <h3>Languages</h3>
                <p>
                    The "Khoisan languages" were proposed as a linguistic phylum by Joseph Greenberg in 1955. Their
                    genetic relationship was questioned later in the 20th century, and the term now serves mostly as a
                    convenience term without implying genetic unity, much like "Papuan" and "Australian" are. Their
                    most notable uniting feature is their click consonants.

                    They are categorized in two families, and a number of possible language isolates.
                    <br><br>
                    The Kxʼa family was proposed in 2010, combining the ǂʼAmkoe (ǂHoan) language with the ǃKung (Juu)
                    dialect cluster. ǃKung includes about a dozen dialects, with no clear-cut delineation between them.
                    Sands et al. (2010) propose a division into four clusters:
                    <br><br>
                    Northern ǃKung (Sekele), spoken in Angola around the Cunene, Cubango, Cuito, and Cuando rivers (but
                    with many refugees now in Namibia),
                    North-Central ǃKung (Ekoka), spoken in Namibia between the Ovambo River and the Angolan border,
                    Central ǃKung, spoken around Grootfontein, Namibia, west of the central Omatako River and south of
                    the Ovambo River
                    Southeastern ǃKung (Juǀ'hoan), spoken in Botswana east of the Okavango Delta, and northeast Namibia
                    from near Windhoek to Rundu, Gobabis, and the Caprivi Strip.
                    <br><br>
                    The Khoi (Khoe) family is divided into a Khoikhoi (Khoekhoe and Khoemana dialects) and a Kalahari
                    (Tshu–Khwe) branch. The Kalahari branch of Khoe includes Shua and Tsoa (with dialects), and Kxoe,
                    Naro, Gǁana and ǂHaba (with dialects). Khoe also has been tentatively aligned with Kwadi
                    ("Kwadi–Khoe"), and more speculatively with the Sandawe language of Tanzania ("Khoe–Sandawe"). The
                    Hadza language of Tanzania has been associated with the Khoisan group due to the presence of click
                    consonants.
                </p><br>

                <h3>Physical characteristics and genetics</h3>
                <p>
                    Charles Darwin wrote about the Khoisan and sexual selection in The Descent of Man in 1882,
                    commenting that their steatopygia, seen primarily in females, evolved through sexual selection in
                    human evolution, and that "the posterior part of the body projects in a most wonderful manner".
                    Historically, some females were observed by anthropologists to exhibit elongated labia minora, which
                    sometimes projected as much as 10 cm below the vulva when standing. Though well documented, the
                    motivations behind this practice and the voices of the women who perform it are rarely explored in
                    the research.
                    <br><br>
                    In the 1990s, genomic studies of the world's peoples found that the Y chromosome of San men share
                    certain patterns of polymorphisms that are distinct from those of all other populations. Because
                    the Y chromosome is highly conserved between generations, this type of DNA test is used to determine
                    when different subgroups separated from one another, and hence their last common ancestry. The
                    authors of these studies suggested that the San may have been one of the first populations to
                    differentiate from the most recent common paternal ancestor of all extant humans.
                    <br><br>
                    Various Y-chromosome studies since confirmed that the Khoisan carry some of the most
                    divergent (oldest) Y-chromosome haplogroups. These haplogroups are specific sub-groups of
                    haplogroups A and B, the two earliest branches on the human Y-chromosome tree.
                    <br><br>
                    Similar to findings from Y-chromosome studies, mitochondrial DNA studies also showed evidence that
                    the Khoisan people carry high frequencies of the earliest haplogroup branches in the human
                    mitochondrial DNA tree. The most divergent (oldest) mitochondrial haplogroup, L0d, has been
                    identified at its highest frequencies in the southern African Khoi and San groups.
                    The distinctiveness of the Khoisan in both matrilineal and patrilineal groupings is a further
                    indicator that they represent a population historically distinct from other Africans.

                <h3>Research and academic centre</h3>
                <p>
                    On 21 September 2020 the University of Cape Town launched its new Khoi and San Centre, with an
                    undergraduate degree programme planned to be rolled out in coming years. The centre will support and
                    consolidate this collaborative work on research commissions on language (including Khoekhoegowab),
                    sacred human remains, land and gender. Many descendants of Khoisan people still live on the Cape
                    Flats.
                </p><br>

                <h3>Khoekhoe</h3>
                <p>
                    Khoekhoen (singular Khoekhoe) (or Khoikhoi in the former orthography; formerly also
                    Hottentots) are the traditionally nomadic pastoralist indigenous population of southwestern
                    Africa. They are often grouped with the hunter-gatherer San (literally "Foragers") peoples. The
                    designation "Khoekhoe" is actually a kare or praise address, not an ethnic endonym, but it has been
                    used in the literature as an ethnic term for Khoe-speaking peoples of Southern Africa, particularly
                    pastoralist groups, such as the !Ora, !Gona, Nama, Xiri and ǂNūkhoe nations.

                    While the presence of Khoekhoen in Southern Africa predates the Bantu expansion, according to a
                    scientific theory based mainly on linguistic evidence, it is not clear when the Khoekhoen began
                    inhabiting the areas where the first contact with Europeans occurred (possibly in the Late Stone
                    Age). At that time, in the 17th century, the Khoekhoen maintained large herds of Nguni cattle in
                    the Cape region. They mostly gave up nomadic pastoralism in the 19th to 20th century.

                    Their Khoekhoe language is related to certain dialects spoken by foraging San peoples of the
                    Kalahari, such as the Khwe and Tshwa, forming the Khoe language family. The main Khoekhoe
                    subdivisions today are the Nama people of Namibia, Botswana and South Africa (with numerous clans),
                    the ǂNūkhoeǃhaos of Namibia, the !Orana clans of South Africa (such as ǀHõakhoena or AmaNgqosini),
                    the Xirikua or Griekwa nation of South Africa, and the AmaGqunukhwebe or !Gona clans which fall
                    under the Xhosa-speaking polities.

                    The Xirikua clans (Griqua) developed their own ethnic identity in the 19th century and settled in
                    Griqualand. They are related to the same kinds of clan formations as the Rehoboth Basters, who could
                    also be considered a "Khoekhoe" people.
                </p><br>

                <h3>History</h3>
                <h4>Early history</h4>
                <p>

                    The broad ethnic designation of "Khoekhoen", meaning the peoples originally part of a pastoral
                    culture and language group to be found across Southern Africa, is thought to refer to a population
                    originating in the northern area of modern Botswana. This culture steadily spread southward,
                    eventually reaching the Cape approximately 2,000 years ago. "Khoekhoe" groups include ǀAwakhoen to
                    the west, and ǀKx'abakhoena of South and mid-South Africa, and the Eastern Cape. Both of these terms
                    mean "Red People", and are equivalent to the IsiXhosa term "amaqaba". Husbandry of sheep, goats and
                    cattle grazing in fertile valleys across the region provided a stable, balanced diet, and allowed
                    these lifestyles to spread, with larger groups forming in a region previously occupied by the
                    subsistence foragers.
                    <br>
                    Ntu-speaking agriculturalist culture is thought to have entered the region in
                    the 3rd century AD, pushing pastoralists into the Western areas. The example of the close relation
                    between the ǃUriǁ’aes (High clan), a cattle keeping population, and the !Uriǁ’aeǀ’ona (High clan
                    children), a more-or-less sedentary forager population (also known as "Strandlopers"), both
                    occupying the area of ǁHuiǃgaeb, shows that the strict distinction between these two lifestyles is
                    unwarranted, as well as the ethnic categories that are derived. Foraging peoples who ideologically
                    value non-accumulation as a social value system would be distinct, however, but the distinctions
                    among “Khoekhoe pastoralists”, “San hunter-gatherers” and “Bantu agriculturalists” do not hold up to
                    scrutiny, and appear to be historical reductionism.
                </p>

                <h4>Arrival of Europeans</h4>
                <p>
                    Khoe-speaking peoples traded with seafarers from all over the globe for centuries, going back into
                    ancient times, and this undoubtedly included some Europeans, perhaps even Roman vessels, but
                    Portuguese explorers and merchants are the first to record their contacts, in the 15th and 16th
                    centuries AD. The ongoing encounters were often violent. In 1510, at the Battle of Salt River,
                    Francisco de Almeida and fifty of his men were killed and his party were defeated by
                    ox-mounted !Uriǁ’aekua ("Goringhaiqua" in Dutch approximate spelling), which was one of the
                    so-called Khoekhoe clans of the area that also included the !Uriǁ’aeǀ’ona ("Goringhaicona", also
                    known as "Strandlopers"), said to be the ancestors of the !Ora nation of today. In the late 16th
                    century, Portuguese, French, Danish, Dutch and English but mainly Portuguese ships regularly
                    continued to stop over in Table Bay en route to the Indies. They traded tobacco, copper and iron
                    with the Khoekhoe-speaking clans of the region, in exchange for fresh meat.
                    <br><br>
                    Local population dropped after smallpox contagion was spread through European activity. The
                    Khoe-speaking clans suffered high mortality as immunity to the disease was rare. This increased, as
                    military conflict with the intensification of the colonial expansion of the United East India
                    Company that began to enclose traditional grazing land for farms. Over the following century, the
                    Khoe-speaking peoples were steadily driven off their land, resulting in numerous northwards
                    migrations, and the reformulation of many nations and clans, as well as the dissolution of many
                    traditional structures.
                    <br><br>
                    "Khoekhoe" social organisation was thus profoundly damaged by the colonial expansion and land
                    seizure from the late 17th century onwards. As social structures broke down, many Khoekhoen settled
                    on farms and became bondsmen (bondservants, serfs) or farm workers; others were incorporated into
                    clans that persisted. Georg Schmidt, a Moravian Brother from Herrnhut, Saxony, now Germany, founded
                    Genadendal in 1738, which was the first mission station in Southern Africa, among the
                    Khoe-speaking peoples in Baviaanskloof in the Riviersonderend Mountains.
                    <br><br>
                    The colonial designation of "Baasters" came to refer to any clans that had European ancestry in some
                    part and adopted certain Western cultural traits. Though these were later known as Griqua (Xirikua
                    or Griekwa) they were known at the time as "Basters" and in some instances are still so called, e.
                    g., the Bosluis Basters of the Richtersveld and the Baster community of Rehoboth, Namibia, mentioned
                    above.
                    <br><br>
                    Arguably responding to the influence of missionaries, the states of Griqualand West and Griqualand
                    East were established by the Kok dynasty; these were later absorbed into the Cape Colony of the
                    British Empire.
                    <br><br>
                    Beginning in the late 18th century, Oorlam communities migrated from the Cape Colony north to
                    Namaqualand. They settled places earlier occupied by the Nama. They came partly to escape Dutch
                    colonial conscription, partly to raid and trade, and partly to obtain herding lands. Some of
                    these emigrant Oorlams (including the band led by the outlaw Jager Afrikaner and his son Jonker
                    Afrikaner in the Transgariep) retained links to Oorlam communities in or close to the borders of the
                    Cape Colony. In the face of gradual Boer expansion and then large-scale Boer migrations away from
                    British rule at the Cape, Jonker Afrikaner brought his people into Namaqualand by the mid-19th
                    century, becoming a formidable force for Oorlam domination over the Nama and against the
                    Bantu-speaking Hereros for a period.
                </p><br>

                <h3>Kat River settlement (1829–1856) and Khoena in the Cape Colony</h3>
                <p>
                    By the early 1800s, the remaining Khoe-speakers of the Cape Colony suffered from restricted civil
                    rights and discriminatory laws on land ownership. With this pretext, the powerful Commissioner
                    General of the Eastern Districts, Andries Stockenstrom, facilitated the creation of the "Kat River"
                    Khoe settlement near the eastern frontier of the Cape Colony. The more cynical motive was probably
                    to create a buffer-zone on the Cape's frontier, but the extensive fertile land in the region allowed
                    people to own their land and build communities in peace. The settlements thrived and expanded, and
                    Kat River quickly became a large and successful region of the Cape that subsisted more or less
                    autonomously. The people were predominantly Afrikaans-speaking !Gonakua, but the settlement also
                    began to attract other diverse groups.
                    <br><br>
                    Khoekua were known at the time for being very good marksmen, and were often invaluable allies of the
                    Cape Colony in its frontier wars with the neighbouring Xhosa politics. In the Seventh Frontier War
                    (1846–1847) against the Gcaleka, the Khoekua gunmen from Kat River distinguished themselves under
                    their leader Andries Botha in the assault on the "Amatola fastnesses". (The young John Molteno,
                    later Prime Minister, led a mixed commando in the assault, and later praised the Khoekua as having
                    more bravery and initiative than most of his white soldiers.)
                    <br><br>
                    However, harsh laws were still implemented in the Eastern Cape, to encourage the Khoena to leave
                    their lands in the Kat River region and to work as labourers on white farms. The growing resentment
                    exploded in 1850. When the Xhosa rose against the Cape Government, large numbers Khoeǀ’ona joined
                    the Xhosa rebels for the first time. After the defeat of the rebellion and the granting of
                    representative government to the Cape Colony in 1853, the new Cape Government endeavoured to grant
                    the Khoena political rights to avert future racial discontent.
                    <br><br>
                    Attorney General William Porter was
                    famously quoted as saying that he "would rather meet the Hottentot at the hustings, voting for his
                    representative, than meet him in the wilds with his gun upon his shoulder". Thus, the government
                    enacted the Cape franchise in 1853, which decreed that all male citizens meeting a low property
                    test, regardless of colour, had the right to vote and to seek election in Parliament. However, this
                    non-racial principle was eroded in the late 1880s by a literacy test, and later abolished by the
                    Apartheid Government.

                <h3>Massacres in German South-West Africa</h3>
                <p>From 1904 to 1907, the Germans took up arms against the Khoikhoi group living in what was then German
                    South-West Africa, along with the Herero. Over 10,000 Nama, more than half of the total Nama
                    population at the time, may have died in the conflict. This was the single greatest massacre ever
                    witnessed by the Khoikhoi people.
                </p><br>

                <h5>Culture</h5>
                <h4>Religion</h4>
                <p>
                    The religious mythology of the Khoe-speaking cultures gives special significance to the Moon, which
                    may have been viewed as the physical manifestation of a supreme being associated with heaven.
                    Thiǁoab (Tsui'goab) is also believed to be the creator and the guardian of health, while ǁGaunab is
                    primarily an evil being, who causes sickness or death. Many Khoe-speakers have converted to
                    Christianity and Nama Muslims make up a large percentage of Namibia's Muslims.
                </p>

                <h4>World Heritage</h4>
                <p>
                    UNESCO has recognised Khoe-speaking culture through its inscription of the Richtersveld as a World
                    Heritage Site. This important area is the only place where transhumance practices associated with
                    the culture continue to any great extent.

                    The International Astronomical Union named the primary component of the binary star Mu¹ Scorpii
                    after the traditional Khoekhoe language name Xami di mûra ('eyes of the lion').

                <h3>List of Khoekhoe peoples</h3>
                <p>
                    The classification of Khoikhoi peoples can be broken down roughly into two groupings: Northern
                    Khoikhoi & Southern Khoikhoi (Cape Khoi).
                </p><br>

                <h4>Northern Khoikhoi</h4>
                <p>

                    The Northern Khoikhoi are referred to as the Nama or Namaqua and they have among them 11 formal
                    clans:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Khaiǁkhaun (Red Nation) at Hoachanas, the main group and the oldest Nama clan in Namibia</li>
                    <li>
                        ǀKhowesen (Direct descendants of Captain Hendrik Witbooi) who was killed in the battle with
                        Germans
                        on 29 October 1905. The |Khowesin, reside in modern-day Gibeon under the leadership of Ismael
                        Hendrik Witbooi the 9th Gaob (meaning captain) of the |Khowesen Gibeon, situated 72 km south of
                        Mariental and 176 km north of Keetmanshoop just off the B1, was originally known by the name
                        Khaxa-tsûs. It received its name from Kido Witbooi first Kaptein of the ǀKhowesin.</li>
                    <li>ǃGamiǂnun (Bondelswarts) at Warmbad</li>
                    <li>ǂAonin (Southern Topnaars) at Rooibank</li>
                    <li>ǃGomen (Northern Topnaars) at Sesfontein</li>
                    <li>
                        ǃKharakhoen (Fransman Nama) at Gochas. After being defeated by Imperial Germany's Schutztruppe
                        in
                        the Battle of Swartfontein on 15 January 1905, this Nama group split into two. Part of the
                        ǃKharakhoen fled to Lokgwabe, Botswana, and stayed there permanently,[21] the part that remained
                        on
                        South West African soil relocated their tribal centre to Amper-Bo. In 2016 David Hanse was
                        inaugurated as chief of the clan.</li>
                    <li>ǁHawoben (Veldschoendragers) at Koës</li>
                    <li>!Aman at Bethanie which was led by Cornelius Frederick</li>
                    <li>ǁOgain (Groot Doden) at Schlip</li>
                    <li>ǁKhauǀgoan (Swartbooi Nama) at Rehoboth, later at Salem, Ameib, and Franzfontein</li>
                    <li>Kharoǃoan (Keetmanshoop Nama) under the leadership of Hendrik Tseib[23] split from the Red
                        Nation in
                        February 1850 and settled at Keetmanshoop.</li>
                    <p>
                        Among the Namaqua are also the Oorlams who are a southern Khoikhoi people of mixed-race ancestry
                        that trekked northwards over the Orange River and where absorbed into the greater Nama identity.
                        The
                        Oorlams themselves are made up of 5 smaller clans:
                    </p>

                    <li>ǀAixaǀaen (Orlam Afrikaners), the first group to enter and permanently settle in Namibia. Their
                        leader Klaas Afrikaner left the Cape Colony around 1770. The clan first built the fortress of
                        ǁKhauxaǃnas, then moved to Blydeverwacht, and finally settled at Windhoek.</li>
                    <li>ǃAman (Bethanie Orlam) subtribe settled at Bethanie at the turn of the eighteenth century.
                        Kaiǀkhauan (Khauas Nama) subtribe formed in the 1830s, when the Vlermuis clan merged with the
                        Amraal
                        family. Their home settlement became Naosanabis (now Leonardville), which they occupied from
                        1840 onward. This clan ceased to exist after military defeat by Imperial German Schutztruppe in
                        1894 and 1896.</li>
                    <li>
                        ǀHaiǀkhauan (Berseba Orlam) subtribe formed in 1850, when the Tibot and Goliath families split
                        from
                        the ǃAman to found Berseba.</li>
                    <li>
                        ǀKhowesin (Witbooi Orlam) subtribe was the last to take up settlement in Namibia. They
                        originated at
                        Pella, south of the Orange River. Their home town became Gibeon.
                    </li>

                    <p>
                        These Namaqua inhabit the Great Namaqualand region of Namibia. There are also minor Namaqua
                        clans
                        that inhabit the Little Namaqualand regions south of the Orange River in north western South
                        Africa.

                        The southern band of Khoekhoe peoples (Sometimes also called the Cape Khoi) inhabit the Western
                        Cape and Eastern Cape Provinces in the south western coastal regions of South Africa. They are
                        further divided into 4 subgroups, Eastern Cape Khoi, Central Cape Khoi, Western Cape Khoi and
                        Peninsular Cape Khoi.

                    <h5>Early European theories about Khoekhoe origins</h5>
                    <p>
                        European theories about the origins of the Khoekhoe are historically interesting in their own
                        right. Of the European theories proposed, notable is that summarised in the commissioned Grammar
                        and Dictionary of the Zulu Language. Published in 1859, this put forward the idea of an
                        origin from Egypt that appears to have been popular amongst men of learning in the region.
                        The reasoning for this included the (supposed) distinctive Caucasian elements of the Khoekhoe's
                        appearance, a "wont to worship the moon'", an apparent similarity to the antiquities of Old
                        Egypt, and a "very different language" to their neighbours. The Grammar says that "the best
                        philologists of the present day ... find marked resemblances between the two". This conviction
                        is echoed in an introduction to the Zulu language, which avidly often comments upon the
                        language's various resemblances to Hebrew.

                        The San religion is the traditional religion and mythology of the San people. It is poorly

                        to translate "Lord" in the Bible, and repeated by San people in reporting what the Khoikhoi told
                        them. It is used in Juǀʼhoan as the word for the Christian god. It has been misinterpreted as
                        the "Bushman creator".
                    </p><br>

                    <h3>Trance</h3>
                    <p>
                        To enter the spirit world, trance has to be initiated by a shaman through the hunting of a
                        tutelary spirit or power animal. The eland often serves as power animal. The fat of the
                        eland is used symbolically in many rituals including initiations and rites of passage. Other
                        animals such as giraffe, kudu and hartebeest can also serve this function.
                        <br><br>
                        One of the most important rituals in the San religion is the great dance, or the trance dance.
                        This dance typically takes a circular form, with women clapping and singing and men dancing
                        rhythmically. Although there is no evidence that the Kalahari San use hallucinogens regularly,
                        student shaman may use hallucinogens to go into trance for the first time.
                        <br><br>
                        Psychologists have investigated hallucinations and altered states of consciousness in
                        neuropsychology. They found that entoptic phenomena can occur through rhythmic dancing, music,
                        sensory deprivation, hyperventilation, prolonged and intense concentration and migraines. The
                        psychological approach explains rock art through three trance phases. In the first phase of
                        trance an altered state of consciousness would come about. People would experience geometric
                        shapes commonly known as entoptic phenomena. These would include zigzags, chevrons, dots,
                        flecks, grids, vortices and U-shapes. These shapes can be found especially in rock engravings of
                        Southern Africa.
                        <br><br>
                        During the second phase of trance people try to make sense of the entoptic phenomena. They would
                        elaborate the shape they had 'seen' until they had created something that looked familiar to
                        them. Shamans experiencing the second phase of trance would incorporate the natural world into
                        their entoptic phenomena, visualizing honeycombs or other familiar shapes.
                        <br><br>
                        In the third phase a radical transformation occurs in mental imagery. The most noticeable change
                        is that the shaman becomes part of the experience. Subjects under laboratory conditions have
                        found that they experience sliding down a rotating tunnel, entering caves or holes in the
                        ground. People in the third phase begin to lose their grip on reality and hallucinate monsters
                        and animals of strong emotional content. In this phase, therianthropes in rock painting can be
                        explained as heightened sensory awareness that gives one the feeling that they have undergone a
                        physical transformation.

                        Pictographs can be found across Southern Africa in places such as the cave sandstone of
                        KwaZulu-Natal, Free State and North-Eastern Cape, the granite and Waterberg sandstone of the
                        Northern Transvaal, the Table Mountain sandstone of the Southern and Western Cape. Images of
                        conflict and war-making are not uncommon. There are also often images of therianthrophic
                        entities which have both human and animal traits and are connected to the notion of trancing,
                        but
                        these represent only a fraction of all rock art representations.
                        <br><br>
                        Most commonly portrayed are
                        animals such as the eland, although grey rhebok and hartebeest are also in rock art in places
                        such
                        as Cederberg and Warm Bokkeveld. At uKhahlamba / Drakensberg Park there are paintings thought to
                        be
                        some 3,000 years old which depict humans and animals, and are thought to have religious
                        significance.
