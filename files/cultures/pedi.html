                    <h3>The Pedi People</h3>
                    <p>
                         The Pedi /pɛdi/ or Bapedi /bæˈpɛdi/ (also known as the Northern Sotho or Basotho ba Leboa and
                         the Marota or Bamaroteng) – are a southern African ethnic group that speak Pedi or Sepedi, a
                         dialect belonging to the Sotho-Tswana enthnolinguistic group. Northern Sotho is a term used
                         to refer to one of South Africa's 11 official languages. Northern Sotho or Sesotho sa Leboa
                         consist of 33 dialects, of which Pedi is one of them.
                         <br><br>
                         The BaPedi people are almost exclusively found in South Africa's northeastern provinces which
                         are Limpopo, and parts of northern Mpumalanga. There is confusion regarding the distinction
                         between BaPedi people, and tribes referred to Northern Sotho (Basotho ba Lebowa). On the one
                         hand, one military explanation is that the BaPedi people became powerful at one point under a
                         powerful king that ruled over a large piece of land. During this period, a powerful army of the
                         BaPedi conquered smaller tribes, and proclaimed paramountcy over them.
                         <br><br>
                         On the other hand,
                         another explanation is that after the decline of one of the BaPedi Kingdom, some tribes
                         separated from the kingship, hence the use of the term Northern Sotho. One reason for
                         separation might be related to the power battle that has been raging for many years between the
                         varying factions in the BaPedi Kingdom. In the year 2020, Judge Ephraim Makgoba made a ruling
                         on the rivalry between members of the BaPedi traditional council.
                         <br><br>
                         The separation of powers between Northern Sotho tribes, and the once powerful BaPedi Kingdom
                         became more vivid during the fragmentation of Northern Transvaal. The Lebowa Bantustan wielded
                         political, economic, and social power in the 1980s with the help of the apartheid government.
                         The Lebowa Bantustan was incorporated into South Africa in 1994. Other Northern Sotho tribes
                         can be found in South Africa's northwestern provinces, and speak various other dialects.
                         <br><br>
                         Examples of tribes with variations of Northern Sotho are found in Seshego, Magoebaskloof,
                         Lebowakgomo, Ga Mamabolo, Ga Mothiba, Ga Dikgale, and Ga Mothapo to mention a few. Some clans
                         in tribes that speak variations of Northern Sotho can be traced back to the
                         Kalanga-Tswana-Sotho group originating from earlier states such as Kingdom of Mapungubwe,
                         Kingdom of Butua, and Great Zimbabwe.
                         <br><br>
                         The once powerful Pedi tribe said to be of North Eastern African origin that migrated to the
                         South during the great migration period. They are now found almost exclusively in South Africa
                         and Botswana.
                         <br><br>
                         Pedi heartland is known as Sekhukhuneland, and is situated between the Olifants and Steelpoort
                         River also known as the Lepelle and the Tubatse.
                    </p><br>

                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <p>
                         Proto-Sotho people migrated south from the Meroë in Northeast Africa making their way along
                         with modern-day western Zimbabwe through successive waves spanning 5 centuries with the last
                         group of Sotho speakers, the Hurutse, settling in the region west of Gauteng around 16th
                         century. It is from this group that the Pedi/Maroteng originated from the Tswana speaking
                         Kgatla offshoot. In about 1650 they settled in the area to the south of the Steelpoort River
                         where over several generations, linguistic and cultural homogeneity developed to a certain
                         degree. Only in the last half of the 18th century did they broaden their influence over the
                         region, establishing the Pedi paramountcy by bringing smaller neighboring chiefdoms under their
                         control.
                         <br><br>
                         During migrations in and around this area, groups of people from diverse origins began to
                         concentrate around dikgoro or ruling nuclear groups. They identified themselves through
                         symbolic allegiances to totemic animals such as tau (lion), kolobe (pig) and kwena (crocodile).
                    </p>

                    <h4>The Marota Empire/ Pedi Kingdom</h4>
                    <p>
                         The Pedi polity under King Thulare (c. 1780–1820) was made up of land that stretched from
                         present-day Rustenburg to the lowveld in the west and as far south as the Vaal river. Pedi
                         power was undermined during the Mfecane, by Ndwandwe invaders from the south-east. A period of
                         dislocation followed, after which the polity was re-stabilized under Thulare's son Sekwati.
                         <br><br>
                         Sekwati succeeded Thulare as paramount chief of the Pedi in the northern Transvaal (Limpopo)
                         and was frequently in conflict with the Matabele under Mzilikazi, and plundered by the Zulu and
                         the Swazi. Sekwati has also engaged in numerous negotiations and struggles for control over
                         land and labor with the Afrikaans-speaking farmers (Boers) who had since settled in the region.
                         <br><br>
                         These disputes over land occurred after the founding of Ohrigstad in 1845, but after the town
                         was incorporated into the Transvaal Republic in 1857 and the Republic of Lydenburg was formed,
                         an agreement was reached that the Steelpoort River was the border between the Pedi and the
                         Republic. The Pedi were well equipped to defend themselves though, as Sekwati and his heir,
                         Sekhukhune I were able to procure firearms, mostly through migrant labor to the Kimberley
                         diamond fields and as far as Port Elizabeth.
                         <br><br>
                         The Pedi paramountcy's power was also cemented by
                         the fact that chiefs of subordinate villages, or kgoro, take their principal wives from the
                         ruling house. This system of cousin marriage resulted in the perpetuation of marriage links
                         between the ruling house and the subordinate groups, and involved the payment of inflated
                         magadi or brideprice mostly in the form of cattle, to the Maroteng house.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Sekhukhune Wars</h4>
                    <p>
                         Sekhukune I succeeded his father in 1861 and repelled an attack against the Swazi. At the time,
                         there were also border disputes with the Transvaal, which lead to the formation of Burgersfort,
                         which was manned by volunteers from Lydenburg. By the 1870s, the Pedi were one of three
                         alternative sources of regional authority, alongside the Swazi and the ZAR (Zuid-Afrikaansche
                         Republiek).
                         <br><br>
                         Overtime, tensions increased after Sekhukhune refused to pay taxes to the Transvaal government,
                         and the Transvaal declared war in May 1876. It became known as the Sekhukhune War, the outcome
                         of which was that the Transvaal commando's attack failed. After this, volunteers nevertheless
                         continued to devastate Sekhukhune's land and provoke unrest, to the point where peace terms
                         were met in 1877.
                         <br><br>
                         Unrest continued, and this became a justification for the British annexing the Transvaal in
                         April 1877, under Sir Theophilus Shepstone. Following the annexation, the British also declared
                         war on Sekhukhune I under Sir Garnet Wolseley, and defeated him in 1879. Sekhukhune was then
                         imprisoned in Pretoria, but later released after the first South African War, when the
                         Transvaal regained independence.
                         <br><br>
                         However, soon after his release Sekhukhune was murdered by his half-brother Mampuru, and
                         because his heir had been killed in the war and his grandson, Sekhukhune II was too young to
                         rule, one of his other half-brothers, Kgoloko assumed power as regent.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Apartheid</h4>
                    <p>
                         In 1885, an area of 1,000 square kilometres (390 sq mi) was set aside for the Pedi, known as
                         Geluk's Location, created by the Transvaal Republic's Native Location Commission. Later,
                         according to apartheid segregation policy, the Pedi would be assigned the homeland of Lebowa.

                    <h4>Use of Totems</h4>
                    <p>
                         Like the other Sotho-Tswana groups, the Bapedi people use totems to identify sister clans and
                         kinship. The most widely used totems are as follows in Sepedi:

                         into kgoro (pl. dikgoro, groups centred on agnatic family clusters). Each consisted of a group
                         of households, in huts built around a central area which served as meeting-place, cattle byre,
                         graveyard and ancestral shrine. Households' huts were ranked in order of seniority. Each wife
                         of a polygynous marriage had her own round thatched hut, joined to other huts by a series of
                         open-air enclosures (lapa) encircled by mud walls. Older boys and girls, respectively, would be
                         housed in separate huts. Aspirations to live in a more modern style, along with practicality,
                         have led most families to abandon the round hut style for rectangular, flat-tin-roofed houses.
                         Processes of forced and semi-voluntary relocation, and an apartheid government planning scheme
                         implemented in the name of "betterment", have meant that many newer settlements, and the
                         outskirts of many older ones, consist of houses built in grid-formation, occupied by individual
                         families unrelated to their neighbors.

                    <h4>Arts</h4>
                    <p>
                         Important crafts included metalsmithing, beadwork, pottery, house-building and painting,
                         woodworking (especially the making of drums). The arts of the Pedi, they are known for metal
                         forging, beading, pottery, woodworking much more in drum making and also painting.

                         Pedi music consists of a single six-note scale traditionally played on reeds, but currently it
                         is played more on a jaw harp or autoharp. Migrants influenced by Kibala music involves playing
                         aluminum pipes of different heights to reproduce vocal harmonies. Traditional dances, women
                         dance on their knees, usually accompanied by drums, backing vocals and with a lead singer,
                         involve vigorous shaking topless from the upper torso while the women kneel on the floor.

                         Songs are also part of Pedi culture. While working the Pedi sang together to finish the job
                         faster, they had A song about killing a Lion to become a man it was a bit peculiar song. The
                         act of killing a Lion is very unusual and is no longer practiced. In fact, it was so unusual
                         that if a boy was successful he would get high status and the ultimate prize - marrying the
                         chief's daughter. The Bapedi, they also have the different types of cultural music:

                         Pedi music (mmino wa setso: traditional music, lit. music of origin) has a six-note scale. The
                         same applies to variants of Mmino wa Setšo as practiced by Basotho ba Leboa (Northern Sotho)
                         tribes in the Capricorn, Blouberg, Waterberg districts, as well as BaVhenda in the Vhembe
                         district. Mmino wa Setšo (indigenous African music) can also be construed as African Musicology
                         - a concept that is often used to distinguish the study of indigenous African music from the
                         dominant ethnomusicology discipline in academe. Ethnomusicology has a strong footprint in
                         academe spanning several decades. Such presence is evident in ethnomusicology journals that can
                         be traced back to the 1950s.
                         <br><br>
                         Ethnomusicologists who study indigenous African music have
                         been criticized for studying the subject from a subjective Western point of view, especially
                         given the dominance of Western musical canon in South Africa. In South Africa, authors such
                         as Mapaya indicate that for many years, African Musicology has been studied from a
                         multi-cultural perspective without music success. Scholars of African Musicology such as
                         Agawu, Mapaya, Nketia and Nzewi emphasize the study of indigenous African music
                         from the perspective, and language of the practitioners (baletši). These scholars argue for the
                         study of African Musicology from an approach that elevates the practitioners, actions, and
                         their interactions.

                    <h4>Categories of Mmino wa Setšo</h4>
                    <p>
                         Mmino wa Setšo in Limpopo province has a number of categories. Categories of Mmino wa Setšo are
                         distinguished according to the function they serve in the community.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Dinaka/Kiba</h4>
                    <p>
                         The peak of Pedi (and northern Sotho) musical expression is arguably the kiba genre, which has
                         transcended its rural roots to become a migrant style. In its men's version, it features an
                         ensemble of players, each playing an aluminum end-blown pipe of a different pitch (naka, pl.
                         dinaka) and together producing a descending melody that mimics traditional vocal songs with
                         richly harmonized qualities. Mapaya provides for a provided for a detailed descriptive
                         analysis of Dinaka/Kiba music and dance, from a Northern Sotho perspective.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Alternative to Dinaka/Kiba</h4>
                    <p>
                         In the women's version, a development of earlier female genres which has recently been included
                         within the definition of kiba, a group of women sings songs (koša ya dikhuru- loosely
                         translated: knee-dance music). This translation has it roots in the traditional kneeling dance
                         that involves salacious shaking movements of the breasts accompanied by chants. These dances
                         are still very common among Tswana, Sotho and Nguni women. This genre comprises sets of
                         traditional songs steered by a lead singer accompanied by a chorus and an ensemble of drums
                         (meropa), previously wooden but now made of oil-drums and milk-urns. These are generally sung
                         at drinking parties and/or during celebrations such as weddings.

                    <h4>Mmino wa bana</h4>
                    <p>
                         Children occupy a special place in the broader category of Mmino wa Setšo. Research shows that
                         mmino wa bana can be examined for its musicological elements, educational validity, and the
                         general social functions.

                    <h3>Kingship</h3>
                    <p>
                         Kgoshi – a loose collection of kinsmen with related males at its core – was as much a jural
                         unit as a kinship one, since membership was defined by acceptance of the kgoro-head's authority
                         rather than primarily by descent. Royal or chiefly kgoros sometimes underwent rapid subdivision
                         as sons contended for positions of authority.
                         <br><br>
                         Marriage was patrilocal. Polygamy was practiced mostly by people of higher, especially chiefly,
                         status. Marriage was preferred with a close or classificatory cousin, especially a mother's
                         brother's daughter, but this preference was most often realised in the case of ruling or
                         chiefly families. Practiced by the ruling dynasty, during its period of dominance, it
                         represented a system of political integration and control recycling of bridewealth (dikgomo di
                         boela shakeng; returning of bride cattle).
                         <br><br>
                         Cousin marriage meant that the two sets of
                         prospective in-laws were closely connected even before the event of a marriage, and went along
                         with an ideology of sibling-linkage, through which the Magadi (bridewealth) procured for a
                         daughter's marriage would, in turn, be used to get a bride for her brother, and he would repay
                         his sister by offering a daughter to her son in marriage. Cousin marriage is still practiced,
                         but less frequently. Polygyny too is now rare, many marriages end in divorce or separation, and
                         a large number of young women remain single and raise their children in small (and often very
                         poor) female-headed households. But new forms of domestic co-operation have come into being,
                         often between brothers and sisters, or matrilineally linked relatives.
                         <br><br>
                         Previously the oldest son of a household within a polygynous family would inherit the
                         house-property of his mother, including its cattle, and was supposed to act as custodian of
                         these goods for the benefit of the household's other children. With the decline of
                         cattle-keeping and the sharp increase in land-shortage, this has switched to a system of
                         last-born inheritance, primarily of land.
                         <br><br>
                         The life-cycle for both sexes was differentiated by important rituals. Both girls and boys
                         underwent initiation. Boys (bašemane, later mašoboro) spent their youth looking after cattle at
                         remote outposts, in the company of peers and older youths. Circumcision and initiation at koma
                         (initiation school), held about once every five years, socialized youths into groups of cohorts
                         or regiments (mephato) bearing the leader's name, whose members then maintained lifelong
                         loyalty to each other, and often traveled together to find work on the farms or on the mines.
                         Girls attended their own koma and were initiated into their own regiments (ditswa-bothuku),
                         usually two years after the boys. Initiation is still practiced, and provides a considerable
                         income to the chiefs who license it for a fee or, in recent years, to private entrepreneurs who
                         have established initiation schools beyond chiefs' jurisdiction

                    <h3>Location</h3>
                    <p>
                         The present-day Pedi area, Sekhukhuneland, is situated between the Olifants River (Lepelle) and
                         its tributary the Steelpoort River (Tubatse); bordered on the east by the Drakensberg range,
                         and crossed by the Leolo mountains. But at the height of its power the Pedi polity under
                         Thulare (about 1780–1820) included an area stretching from the site of present-day Rustenburg
                         in the west to the Lowveld in the east, and ranging as far south as the Vaal River.
                         <br><br>
                         Reliable historians and sources also credit the Pedi kingdom as the first and dominant monarchy
                         established in the region. The kingdom, which boasted numerous victories over the Boers and the
                         British armies, was one of the strongest and largest in Southern Africa in the mid to late
                         1800s under the warrior king Sekhukhune I, whose kingdom stretched from the Vaal River in the
                         south to the Limpopo River in the north.
                         <br><br>
                         The area under Pedi control was severely limited when the polity was defeated by British troops
                         in 1879. Reserves were created for this and for other Northern Sotho groups by the Transvaal
                         Republic's Native Location Commission. Over the next hundred years or so, these reserves were
                         then variously combined and separated by a succession of government planners. By 1972 this
                         planning had culminated in the creation of an allegedly independent national unit or "homeland"
                         named Lebowa.
                         <br><br>
                         In terms of the government's plans to accommodate ethnic groups separated from
                         each other, this was designed to act as a place of residence for all Northern Sotho speakers.
                         But many Pedi had never resided here: since the polity's defeat, they had become involved in a
                         series of labor-tenancy or sharecropping arrangements with white farmers, lived as tenants on
                         crown land, or purchased farms communally as freeholders, or moved to live in the townships
                         adjoining Pretoria and Johannesburg on a permanent or semi-permanent basis. In total, however,
                         the population of the Lebowa homeland increased rapidly after the mid-1950s, due to the forced
                         relocations from rural areas and cities in common South Africa undertaken by apartheid's
                         planners, and to voluntary relocations by which former labor tenants sought independence from
                         the restrictive and deprived conditions under which they had lived on the white farms
                    </p><br>

                    <h3>Subsistence and economy</h3>
                    <p>
                         The pre-conquest economy combined cattle-keeping with hoe cultivation. Principal crops were
                         sorghum, pumpkins and legumes, which were grown by women on fields allocated to them when they
                         married. Women hoed and weeded; did pottery and built and decorated huts with mud; made
                         sleeping mats and baskets; ground grain, cooked, brewed, and collected water and wood. Men did
                         some work in fields at peak times; hunted and herded; did woodwork, prepared hides, and were
                         metal workers and smiths. Most major tasks were done communally by matsema
                         (work-parties).
                         <br><br>
                         The chief was depended upon to perform rain-making for his subjects. The introduction of the
                         animal-drawn plow, and of maize, later transformed the labor division significantly, especially
                         when combined with the effects of labor migration. Men's leaving home to work for wages was
                         initially undertaken by regimental groups of youths to satisfy the paramount's firepower
                         requirements but later became increasingly necessary to individual households as population
                         increase within the reserve and land degradation made it impossible to subsist from cultivation
                         alone. Despite increasingly long absences, male migrants nonetheless remained committed to the
                         maintenance of their fields: plowing had now to be carried out during periods of leave or
                         entrusted to professional plowmen or tractor owners.
                         <br><br>
                         Women were left to manage and carry out
                         all other agricultural tasks. Men, although subjected to increased controls in their lives as
                         wage-laborers, fiercely resisted all direct attempts to interfere with the sphere of
                         cattle-keeping and agriculture. Their resistance erupted in open rebellion – ultimately subdued
                         – during the 1950s. In later decades, some families have continued to practice cultivation and
                         to keep stock. These activities should more accurately be seen as demonstrating a long-term
                         commitment to the rural social system to gain security in retirement than as providing a viable
                         form of household subsistence.
                         <br><br>
                         In the early 1960s, about 48% of the male population was absent as wage-earners at any given
                         time. Between the 1930s and the 1960s, most Pedi men would spend a short period working on
                         nearby white farms followed by a move to employment on the mines or domestic service and later
                         – especially in more recent times – to factories or industry. Female wage employment began more
                         recently and is rarer and more sporadic. Some women work for short periods on farms, others
                         have begun, since the 1960s, to work in domestic service in the towns of the Witwatersrand. But
                         in recent years there have been rising levels of education and of expectation, combined with a
                         sharp drop in employment rates. Many youths, better-educated than their parents and hoping for
                         jobs as civil servants or teachers, stand little chance of getting employment of any kind.

                    <h4>Land tenure</h4>
                    <p>
                         The pre-colonial system of communal or tribal tenure, being broadly similar to that practiced
                         throughout the southern African region, was crystallized, but subtly altered, by the colonial
                         administration. A man was granted land by the chief for each of his wives; unused land was
                         reallocated by the chief, rather than being inherited within families. Overpopulation resulting
                         from the government's relocation policies resulted in this system being modified – a
                         household's fields, together with its residential plot, are now inherited, ideally by the
                         youngest married son.
                         <br><br>
                         Christian Pedi communities who owned freehold farms were removed to the
                         reserve without compensation, but since 1994 South Africa many have now reoccupied their land
                         or are preparing to do so, under restitution legislation. The few Pedi who still live as labor
                         tenants on white farms have been promised some security of tenure by land reform legislation.

                    <h3>Religion</h3>
                    <p>
                         Ancestors are viewed as intermediaries between humans and The Creator or God (Modimo/Mmopi) and
                         are communicated to by calling on them using a process of burning incense, making an offering
                         and speaking to them (go phasa). If necessary, animal sacrifice may be done or beer presented
                         to the shades on both the mother's and father's side. A key figure in the family ritual was the
                         kgadi (who was usually the father's elder sister).
                         <br><br>
                         The position of ngaka (diviner) was formerly
                         inherited patrilineally but is now commonly inherited by a woman from her paternal grandfather
                         or great-grandfather. This is often manifested through illness and through violent possession
                         by spirits (malopo) of the body, the only cure for which is to train as a diviner. There has
                         been a proliferation of diviners in recent times, with many said to be motivated mainly by a
                         desire for material gain.
